It&#x27;s possible that you might of heard the commercial for it if you live around her. Has the most annoying damn jingle I have heard within recent memory.

A thought actually came up when I was thinking that. Recently Carnage and I was talking about metal smithing/leather working (him more geared towards metal, with myself looking at leather working.) and I wonder if the school would frown upon finding a little armor smithy trying to make rough platemail, chainmail, and harden leather.

Then they might question the swords we may try to smuggle in...

Perhaps if we set up an Armoring club?</div>

I came up with this name christmas morning when I installed my brand new Unreal Tournament GOTY Edition.  That was like...5th grade or something.  I had previously just gone by the handle &quot;Carnage&quot; but in Unreal Tournament whenever you played on a team, the people kept calling you Captain.  Hence I was like hey, I&#x27;ll have my name as Captain Carnage because it sounds like they&#x27;re directly talking to me.</div>

Despite the Quake games completely not following any kind of canon or story, and Quake 4 being a direct sequel to Quake 2 that never mentions anything about him outside of &quot;a lone marine.&quot; During the opening video, you can hear the radio operator screaming &quot;Bitterman! Bitterman! Shit, we&#x27;ve lost him!&quot; or something to that effect. Also if you turn to inspect your own crashed pod at the opening of the game, it clearly has Bitterman written on the nose in some kind of script font.</div>

Although for me nothing happens... I just keep going to work. Sometimes I do sneak out and buy up some back to school supplies though. I&#x27;ve always been a bit obsessed with notebooks, wire bound, college ruled, five subject, pocket sized, what have you... and some of those Bic mechanical pencils... and the undeniable nerd in me sometimes has to get a tablet of graph paper, for which i have no pratical use... but it makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.</div>

I have to ask, Did they do something lame like setting the paper on fire with matches, or was there flammable liquids involved?

And Skeller, Bic mechanical pencils? For shame, Pentel mechanical pencils is where it is at. Rather, the point three millimeters pro/am type is what I favor. If you could find the bleeding things in stores. Always with the .5 and .7, hell I saw a .9 earlier today but not .3 mm.

The paint job isn&#x27;t final but I was starting to rush so I had to stop and relax for a bit. It&#x27;s all custom. Built from just about everything I could get my hands on. Took about 28 hours I think give or take (Alot of which was trying to figure out what I was gonna do next. I also dropped it once and reduced it to its component parts.) Yes, that is a space marine dreadnought in the first pic.

Hmm... list of materials... 

I started with a plastic flower pot and then added a round electrical gang box, lots of CPVC and PVC pipe, five or six different types of plasticard and varying sizes of plastic tubing. You can see my stash of tubing in the background in the first pic. I used the pill bottle you mentioned and a few peices of that pink foam insulation, some masonite and some phone wiring I found in the dirt. I scavenged the main engine part and a bit of robot arm from an action figure. I got the gears from a lighting timer and a toy truck. The Deff Kannon, part of the Giga Shoota and part of the Lifta Droppa all came from the same old ornamental garden pond fountain spout thingy. The rest is bits from 40K miniatures and cut up sprues.

All told it cost me about 13$, which was mainly spent on plasticard most of which I didn&#x27;t use and thrift store toys... most of which I didn&#x27;t use.

It was alot of fun to build. I think I might make another one... or finish my Ork Kastle. I&#x27;m thinking about up rooting my Kastle and adding a gigantic track assembly for a mobile battle fortress!

Maybe I&#x27;ll take a picture of the Kastle tomorrow.</div>

In other news, Mad Dok Morkensteins Kastle!

I still have to finish the walls (wood and plates) and add all the electro lightning harnessing junk on top of the tower. It&#x27;ll need some big shootas and alot of Mad Dok paraphernalia, like buckets of arms and lots of giant syringes and such. I was going to remove all the pink foam and put it on some giant tank tracks...but I have since been convinced otherwise.</div>

A comment from their spin on this story seems to put some perspective on this.

Thomas wrote:As already said it is Activision and Vivendi Games that are merging, Blizzard being a subsidiary of Vivendi Games are obviously in this merge as well.

As for “Activision Blizzard”, i guess the easy answer here is that we have 2 companies with a VERY good track record of games, Vivendi’s track record isn’t THAT good unfortunately.

Slap a new brand on their Games sections using a legendary developer and publisher and you can use that to sell your mediocre titles.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">Exactly. No one has heard of Vivendi because they haven&#x27;t been marketing themselves correctly.

They bought Sierra entertainment, which back in the day published a little game known as Half Life. Don&#x27;t know if you heard of it. It wasn&#x27;t very good. There was also Psychonaughts more recently, which was good, but nobody played it.

Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but Activision and Blizz were already owned by Vivendi so this is more of an internal money swap that makes a new company? Meh. More mega mergers to increase stock prices, while nothing new really happens so the consumer just gets more of the same old shit in a new wrapper.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">You should be happy. These days Blizzard makes one game really well. But they have so much extra revenue, 500 and some million dollars that they can now use to develop new titles. Since the Executives from Activision are taking over the reigns the wealth and power along with the good name of Blizzard ( well known to the billions of people in Asia through WoW) they will begin producing tons of new console games and someplace in there they will need level designers.

                    <div class="post-content">you guys are crazy paranoid...

It&#x27;s been semi broken down, but I&#x27;ll do it again (more simply)

Vivendi Universal Games (VUG) is a big publisher...they are worldwide and do a bunch of games

VUG owns Sierra. (Kings Quest, Space Quest, HL1, HL2, etc...been around since the 80&#x27;s) They also own Blizzard, who was once many years ago an independent developer

Activision is another large publisher, they mostly make rehashes of old games, licensed games, and sequels. (then again how many games have Blizzard made in their entire history that weren&#x27;t either a sequel, expansion, or offshoot of an existing IP? Oh that&#x27;s right, none.)

Activision merged with VUG, and for whatever reason decided to rename themselves Activision Blizzard, while keeping Sierra Games a separate division of the company, continuing to focus on the publishing of games from independent developers.

The most obvious benefit that can been seen from this is that Vivendi is associated with (possibly owns...I forget) Universal Music. Activision owns/makes Guitar Hero. Hmm...massive library of music to access? check.

Other benefits include a company that is now worth 18.7 BILLION dollars that has a history of actually giving a shit about independent developers making new titles. The bigger the wallet the publisher has, the way huger the budget every game can get. 

Vivendi (was, now is Sierra Games...same difference) our publisher, and they have treated us like gold. Actually, gold doesn&#x27;t get treated as good as we do. I don&#x27;t know about any other developers they are working with, but I can personally say they have been extremely kind to us (and definitely not cheap with us.)

So don&#x27;t get your knickers in a twist. Every thing&#x27;s fine.

Anyway there is something left, we did make a project for the Collections Office and we spoke with some people on high command, so if it&#x27;s not by this tuesday on Jan 3rd we should get an answer if we could become contractors and get something or not. Shit sucks anyway.

I think Carnages must have been somewhere in his list, but I didn&#x27;t catch what it was.

I know Skydog got his, cuz I sent that shit. But I figure he&#x27;s over the river and through the woods about this time of day on a Christmas so I don&#x27;t expect to him to be around here today.  Hopefully my present didn&#x27;t escape and eat him and his family. That would suck.

Funniest thing about it was, my youngest son who is ten wanted to know who Uncle Skeller was and why he didn&#x27;t get him a present. 

Pictures will be forthcoming once we play our first game either this evening or tomorrow.

As for goodies from the wife and kids. I got the following DVD&#x27;s Die Hard 2, Omega Man (Woot), Close Encounters of the Third Kind 30th Anniversary Box Set, Battlestar Galatica Miniseries, Seasons 1, 2 and 2.5. Then for my desktop action figure set I got the Rethgar Deathgate Shaman action figure, Jean Grey from X3 and Boba Fett concept Ed. I also got 4 lbs of licorice - I love the stuff, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone Hardback and a stocking full of junk food.

I&#x27;m Skeller. You may remember me from such random stuff as Border Crossing, The Bitterman for President war, or calling Billy Crosby a Douchebag. Well folks, I&#x27;m here to tell you about something new, something special. This holiday season, your favorite website and forums, Poison the Mind, will be bringing you to a whole new level of joy. This year we will be hosting a (not so) Secret Santa Holiday Gift Exchange Extravaganza. That&#x27;s right folks free presents, from the folks at PTM to the folks at PTM. So sign up now (deadline for sign up is October 10th). PM me your name and mailing address to be added to the list. Then on October 11th I&#x27;ll mix up all the names in a hat and randomly pull them out and match them up. Then the magic begins. Everyone who is participating gets a name and address of a fellow PTM member and buys, makes, or steals them an awesome present they would especially enjoy. Next, they wrap it up, and then mail it off anytime in December before Christmas. People who have to mail things really far may need to send out theirs earlier.

                    <div class="post-content">Sup dudes, it&#x27;s October, and you know what that means, halloween! At work we have an actual contest, prizes and everything, for best costume. This guy Dusty has won the last two years in a row, and it&#x27;s my job to take him down. Well, that&#x27;s looking unlikely, he&#x27;s crazy, but I gotta at least put in a genuine effort (plus I love dressing up for halloween anyway). So I need your ideas for a bitchin costume. Word on the street is they (the whole company judges via inter-office forum poll) tend to favor costumes of existing and at least moderately well known characters. Now, these people are nerds, so game/comic/cartoon/old action movie references shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.

I&#x27;d like to do something that works with my existing &quot;look&quot; (most notably the long hair since that&#x27;s a pain to work around) if possible.

To give you an idea of my competition Dusty was a fully 3d mario bro&#x27;s Piranha Plant (fully sphereical plant head and warp pipe and everything, think mario rpg style) made mostly of cardboard, papermache and paint.

Current ideas include:

-Snake Plisskin - awesome character, but might make for a less impressive costume
-Beyond The Grave (Gungrave) - kind of obscure and would be a lot of work
-Alucard (Hellsing) - eh...anime...too overdone plus lots of fabric work

So yeah...any long haired badasses you can think of?

My friend/coworker is going to be the Vault Dweller, so something fallout related would be awesome, but I cant think of anyone awesome from the game that had anything other than a buzzcut (Ian, Cassidy)

I have also considered being a custom misc post apoc badass, but that might loose votes for the contest...</div>

Today at work Steve, Erin, and myself have all dressed up like pirates. Nothing is funnier than talking to a business man wearing a full on suit, and you&#x27;re standing there in a bandanna, an eye patch, a mustache you painted on with a permanent marker, a flintlock on your hip, and all of your coworkers also dressed as pirates with a talking mechanical parrot on the front desk., all the while trying to explain to him which wireless router he needs. And doing it all with a straight face like nothing is wrong, nothing is out of the ordinary.

I have found that in countries other than the USA you can get some really sweet over the counter hangover meds... filled with opiates and caffine.

Such as SOLPADEINE Plus in the UK and surrounding environs. 

Hangover + Codine + Caffine =  Good

You just have to look around or ask, I bet Japan is all crapped up with awesome drugs.

Or just start drinking again, that&#x27;s what I do.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">hangovers just come from the dehydration you get from drinking alcohol. The alcohol acts as a diuretic, which is why when you drink booze you have to pee a lot more than when drinking non-alcoholic beverages. Basically all the water just passes through your system without being taken into the body for appropriate use, so even though you&#x27;re drinking liquids consisting of 80% water you&#x27;re not getting anything out of it.

As such, the best (and nearly perfect, as long as you don&#x27;t drink too much, too much being enough to make you puke or pushing the limits around that area) way to avoid getting a hangover is to drink water after you finish drinking for the night. Try to wait until the alcohol has passed through your system a little (so that the diuretic effect is as weak as possible) and then drink several glasses of water before going to bed. You&#x27;ll want to drink maybe one glass of water for every 3 or so beers (or equivalent amounts of alcohol). After a certain point though the amount of water you need to recover for the damage done by the alcohol becomes some what exponential though, and as such can eventually become impossible to avoid a hangover. That said though, you should always try your best anyway, because any amount of water put back into your system is better than none.

Oh, and coffee, soda, and tea will only make it worse, as those will only further dehydrate you. The reason that mixing with juice would seem to worsen the effect is because juices are high in sugar (natural or otherwise) and sugar will also aid in the dehydration process.

This information is from science (glorious glorious science, where would we be without you?) by the way, not just random personal experiments, however I have never known someone who has had poor results with the method.</div>

the reason it gets all crazy with the % is because i was using my japanese cellphone to reply to these posts because its the only internet i have available to me half the time... 

anyhow we randomly have an exchange student from india staying at our dorm and hes a fuckin bad ass indian jones kinda guy whos been around the world studying tribe mentality, and he has this really cool remedy for hangovers that indian people use..

its 1 to 2 shots of any dark rum 3/4ths a cup of hot water and 4 - 5  tablespoons of black pepper and curry powder you put a plate on top of the glass and let the peppers soak in for 5 minutes then you down the whole thing in one go stopping about an inch from finishing off the whole thing so you dont get a mouth full of the worst tasting pepper residue youve ever had..

this shit will clear you up instantly and make you feel like your stomach had an attomic bomb detonate from the inside out, 

great shit i highly recomend you try it at least once.</div>

1) Go to http://submit.poisonthemind.com

2) Go to Gallery Management

3) First you&#x27;ll click Upload.

4) Upload your files, all of your files that you want to submit.

5) Go back to gallery management, or click the &quot;Step 2&quot; link at the bottom.

6) This is where you will actually tag, label, and submit your stuff.

Once that is done, you&#x27;re done. Then it comes to me, I authorize it, and it&#x27;ll post. Then I make you Certified, and whenever you submit something from then on it will go straight in.

The process becomes clearer once you&#x27;ve done it, and that is primarily what I intend to fix. The usability of the whole system. Right now it&#x27;s kinda vague.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">So heres the deal, In japan if you dont love your Ramen your fucked, because thats basically all they have around here... lookily its some delicious stuff, I have a few favorites and at one of them that i visit often they offer comment cards and if your comment is good enough your card is photocopied to the back of the menu.

of course the first thing i do when i pick up a pen is draw some hideous thing, so every time i go went there i draw a crazed looking person screaming DELICIOUS RAMEN or おいし！ which means delicious.. 

anyhow i drew like 5 of these before i started taking pictures,... the quality is crap because it is from my cellphone but its the best i got... with more to come..
I swear im either getting in the back of this menu or im going to get arrested.. either way its a good story.

and yes i have been drawing in japan including a comic page but i just dont have access to a good enough scanner to post anything unfortunatly -_-::</div>

                    <div class="post-content">A week or two ago, Jason and I sat round the table, discussing ideas that we could do for halloween.  We thought about getting some movies, eating some candy, but other than that the plan seemed somewhat dull.  I brought up the idea that maybe we could get some dry ice and make some fog, or put it ontop of the fridge so it billows down to the floor.  That&#x27;s how the conversation derailed a bit, and we started talking about dry ice and pressure and about half an hour later we both decided it was a great idea.

We were going to build a &quot;steam&quot; engine that ran on dry ice.

Now, the first thing we had to do was ask the RA (Residential Advisor) here at the college dorms if dry ice was violating any of the forbidden materials rules.  I went up to her room and asked her about the dry ice probably for halloween and possibly for a side project that Jason and I were thinking about.

She honestly had no idea, so she called her supervisor friend.

He had no idea and told her to call the Housing Director.

She called the Housing Director and she had no idea, and said to call her higher-up.

 So apparently I asked something that nobody has thought of before, and they had to bounce around all over the higher ups in the college until some guy came to our apartment and told jason (at the same time that the RA bumped into me at school and told me) that dry ice was fine and we could do whatever.  SO...  we went to Fleet Farm and wandered around the piping section for awhile, calling measurements of pipe back and forth to eachother, each of his mentally figuring out how to put this together.  We seemed to attract the attention of a store worker, who walked up to me.

Him: &quot;You boys must have one hell of a plumbing problem.&quot;
Me: &quot;Nope, building a steam engine.&quot;

So we got back home, looked at one or two parts we bought and started talking about designs, after we had just got done looking at what we had to work with.  We eventually would go back to the store 3 times, replacing parts, buyi</div>

                    <div class="post-content">yeah, I don&#x27;t think that no one has used dry ice in the dorms before, I think you&#x27;re just the first to ask for permission haha. That&#x27;s not a bad thing though, it was good of you to try to abide by the rules, no one likes any surprise fines or violations. That&#x27;s a level of accountability and respect that you just don&#x27;t normally see in the dorms haha.

As for the steam engine, sounds like a pretty ambitious project, I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results</div>

                    <div class="post-content">I talked with a physics professor today up at college.  She helped me figure out a few calculations that I had been wondering, and apparently the mechanical advantage will work better with this idea I had, so the design has been altered drastically.  The professor was very interested in the project, hell, she even asked if we were going to have it generate electricity (an electromagnetic generator).  That was an idea that jason had, and we may still do it in a later model/revision of the train, but for now we&#x27;re just powering the wheels.

She wants us to bring it up for a demonstration after we finish it and have it running fine.  This basically gives us an excuse to do it on campus, and gives us an alliby.

Now I need to buy chains and sprockets.  Joy.  Also, we apparently have to soder the copper piping together.  This entire thing is one giant experient and we&#x27;re pretty much just making it up as we go.  Good times.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">Nah man it&#x27;s like awesome.

But let&#x27;s get down to business. Found Zork, played it, felt good. Didn&#x27;t reach too far but I&#x27;ve always loved text-games and seeing the father of all text-games left me again with the feeling to start doing my own, again, like for the 40th time.

But this time I lurked, and I lurked well, because I found the answer. Inform 7, a program that is rather... funny and amazing, is easy to use and easy to learn.
You don&#x27;t need to learn new languages and fuck C#/C++/Java/LISP or whatever man because I honestly can&#x27;t be bothered taking a whole year of learning to get this rolling and taking me another year to get it working. Inform just takes what you write, as if it was a true written story, and turns it into the game.

It&#x27;s awesome.

But why post this on a board that hasn&#x27;t been used for months? Because I need YOU. I need people to make maybe a cover art for the thing and also to play test the thing. Hopefully I can get something up for you guys tonight but I wouldn&#x27;t push it, yeah it&#x27;s that easy but some of the commands are just weird, on the other hand I learn and work fast so 50/50.

I await to hear any comments. Surge out.</div>

I actually started some art for this, it was a meat grinder that you fed stuff in to on one end, and it fed little neat squares of bits and data out the other side onto a conveyor belt.

The belt just kinda dropped them off into eternity. Not sure where they went after that. Probably why the damn thing doesn&#x27;t work.</div>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Furious Snake, is a the nottorious leader of a mediocore nomadic bandit horde, who scourge around the wasteland piled into jury rigged wind-sail go-karts. Furious is a large man, with mean features. He wears some kinda armor (flak vest, scrap metal suit, chainmail bikini breifs, whatever), and is never without his infamous &quot;Voodoo Hat&quot;, which he believes gives him luck. Furious loves knives and sharp pointy things and always has several of these strapped to his person. He also bears a rather exciting snake tattoo and wears a necklace of monkey bones...or are those babies? His signature weapon is a battle axe type of thing, a large heavy blade on a stick, and along with that he carries a hefty sidearm.

     Furious Snake is always accompanied by his righthand man...er...girl...Black Eyed Susan, a lanky broad with a robotic arm and a collection of shrunken heads. She chain smokes hand rolled cigarettes and covers her ass with a conglomeration of leather, pelts, and shiny bits of metal. Her weapons of choice are a long handled spear cobbled together from everyday household items and a matched set of bone handled nickel plated six shooters, she wears slung low.

     Furious Snake, being such a charismatic chap, is also attended by a loyal sidekick, Feekal, a freeky mutant wih extra bits. Feekal is swaddled in grimey rags and sports a gigantic gun (bazooka, speargun,radial flux beamer, whatever). Feekal carries a stereo boom box, for times when he feels the need to bust a move, and because he is the sidekick he also carries all of Furious Snake&#x27;s extraneous gear (liquor, smokes, ammo, waffles, jimmy hats, whatever) in, strapped to or sticking out of a (satchel, back pack, ruck sack, hollowed out pigs head, whatever).

Thanks for all that entered you guys did a kick ass job, and I consider this contest a huge success because of you guys.
Man bitter I love that axe and timmys entry is bad ass too, 

I think my brain nearly exploded with the mental instability at imagining hack saw jim dugan as bitterman though 
you got warn people when you exploit childhood memories like that i almost died laughing.

personally I see a post apocalyptic thor in your images, I think we need to make a series of short movies based on that.

well now comes the hard part, for me at least as I go about judging this shin dig-

Since Im obviously too deep into this, im going to be taking your images to people I know and mabey some i dont have them judge them, once I get at least 10 peoples oppinions ill list the results and distribute prizes accordingly.

thanks alot guys I will post you the results when i get them,</div>

Yeah, if you didn&#x27;t notice, Carnage finally got off his lazy ass and started making new gil and zen. And as far as he has been telling me, he plans on working on it for a while.

Or maybe he is still a wiener.

All of the music in Halo was composed by Martin O&#x27;Donnel. It was on the Halo 2 soundtrack that they got actual bands to do tributes or covers or &quot;inspired by&quot; or whatever you want to call them. There was a piece of the Making Of on the Limited/Legendary Halo 3 Edition discs that focused squarely on the music and sound. One of the more interesting parts of the entire process or documentary in my opinion.

                    <div class="post-content">I was going to skim over history and point out evil master minds who were in fact nerds, but it turned out to be too much work. The key here is going against the grain and unlikely situations is not only part of the humor, it&#x27;s a distinct writing style because it separates you from the pack. All elves are not magical. All dwarves do not have to hate elves. Just because Tolken wrote it once doesn&#x27;t make it the status quo.

This is something they tried to push with 3rd Edition Dungeons and Dragons, the idea that even a brutish Orc could make a good Rogue, despite having no stealthy qualities what so ever because he smells funny, he lumbers around too heavily to sneak anywhere, and no shadow is large enough for him to hide inside of. Yet with some careful thought and creativity an Orc could be a perfect rogue. He doesn&#x27;t pick pockets, he outright takes pockets. He doesn&#x27;t work with a silver tongue and charm, he works with fear and intimidation.

Or maybe he does have all of these qualities. Maybe he was abandoned at youth for being scrawny and weak, qualities despised by his strong blood orc family. Maybe he used ash or makeup to attempt to hide his appearance or identity. Maybe he turned to a life of theifdom to survive, and is in fact quite a good text book rogue because of his background and upbringing.

So just because Ian is a wiener, that doesn&#x27;t have to drag down the story. Besides, Ian is only a wiener because you actually know him. I&#x27;ve only played Halo with him. I cannot verify his wienerdom.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">Well, the good news is here: Counterblow 2 is under production. It isn&#x27;t very far, we just started the beginning, but i think it should be done by the end of thanksgiving break. It marks the direct sequel of Me and Terrence chasing Ian for our game back. This will conclude the &quot;Halo 3&quot; spoof, but we will (If this is good) make more, including a Christmas special focusing on &quot;Metal Gear Solid,&quot; thanks to Terrence, whose writing that version.

So anyway, I think the current release date for Counterblow 2 is: Saturday, November 24th. 

That isn&#x27;t at all permanent, but just a rough guess. It may even be done earlier, but Saturday is probably going to mark it&#x27;s completion.</div>

Anyway, I&#x27;m just posting about the short story I&#x27;m working on.

I&#x27;m not going to give away the plot and setting quite yet, but I will share the fact that it will be a sort of multi-perspective piece, with hint&#x27;s at each character&#x27;s viewpoint of the situation.  I think the situation&#x27;s pretty neat, but that will have to be decided by each reader.

Anyways, I guess I should ask a question or something to promote posting, so what do you think?  Should I release it in individual perspectives, or just wait until I have the whole thing done?</div>

In The Dead of the Night

Huddled in the darkness

Silently he hides

Hoping to escape the stalkers

Hunting him outside.

And as he peers through the window

Into their hollow eyes

It seems as though his fate is clear

That tonight, he dies.

Gnawing on their victim&#x27;s flesh

And picking at their bones

Merciless they came

To each and all our homes.

They smelled of a putrid stench

With their skin long decayed

Bloody the dead rose this night

From their now empty graves.

Behind locked and bolted doors

David sits alone

Hoping that these things would keep him

Safe inside his home.

And he thinks of all those people

All those he knew and loved

Now stood outside his doorway

Thirsting for his blood.

At the sound of breaking glass

He jolted in alarm

And then came a painful grasp

That gripped around his arm.

One of them had broke inside

So close now he felt it&#x27;s breath

Then nails raked at his arm

Tearing at his flesh.

As the thing&#x27;s jaws bit on down

the others hungrily called

And with a kick he broke the hold

And ran out to the halls.

He stumbled into the kitchen

And studied his bloodied hand

And knew this was when and where

He&#x27;d make his final stand.

He knew now that he&#x27;d been bit

There was no way to win

But he would not allow himself

To become one of them.

Against their numbers he would fall

This much he could see

And then he said with a snarling hate

&quot;I&#x27;ll take them all down with me!&quot;.

He stumbled into the garage

His heart racing fast

And grabbed from beneath a</div>

Aside from some of the grammar issues, which if I recall English is your second language*, the only critical thing I have to say is at the end the jump from when the corporal is yelling at Scivio to the next paragraph is jarring. After reading it twice, I got what you were getting across but it was very confusing. Especially since I take it the &#x27;box&#x27; had something to do with what Scivio did, but you didn&#x27;t mention the box earlier in the story. Or I could be wrong about that...

Still I liked the story, I liked the hinted at background you gave us on this new world of yours and especially liked the suspense you were building up with Scivio in his head. 

*I am impressed that anyone can master a second  language enough to write a story in it, so don&#x27;t let grammar bother you. After all that&#x27;s what editors are for. Hell, english is my first language and I screw it up all the time, not to mention if I tried to write a story in spanish, it would be two sentences about a man asking about your house and if he can have some more beer. lol.</div>

Really any of them could, because they&#x27;ve already got their 3D models for the Olympics game, it&#x27;s just a matter of repurposing them for Brawl. I don&#x27;t know who could or would show up alongside Snake. I also expect we&#x27;ll see another Star Fox character this time, like Slippy or Falco.

I don&#x27;t know some time ago, basically it&#x27;s my return to writing regularly and more importantly actually writing stories. It isn&#x27;t a story I particularly like the progress of and neither is it one I have invested greatly in before I began writing, so basically it&#x27;s all momemtum that&#x27;s keeping it going.

Whenever I update I&#x27;ll put some notes next to it so check out the recent changes section and you&#x27;ll see what I put.

Give it a look, lend me some comments either here or on Alchemy, doesn&#x27;t have to be anything special.

                    <div class="post-content">The Secret Mort story, here in the NRC has been going on for three years. Sometimes it has really rolled with lots of people writting lots of bits fast and hard. Mostly it&#x27;s been slow. I created Secret Mort back in the early ninties and he has been all over doing all kinda of nefarious shit. Stories and drawings, tales retold around the camp fire and over beers on the porch. To me, Mort is a post apocalyptic Icon. Which brings me to my point. The Secret Mort stories have always been a group activity. I&#x27;ve thought of just going it alone and writing more of his adventures by myself. But that removes the basic principles Mort was built on. I don&#x27;t wanna do that. There&#x27;s a little bit of Mort in all of us and I&#x27;d like to bring it out and put it all together. So here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m gonna do. The 30 days of Secret Mort is a project type contest. Everyone who contributes at least three decent story enhancing posts to the Winter Wonder Wasteland story here in the NRC, in the 30 days from April 5th 2005 to May 5th 2005, will recieve (no really) a prize. The prize will be a printed and fancily bound copy of the story with as many illustrations of the text as I can work up in a reasonable amount of time. I&#x27;ve already started on the art for the book, all you people of Nurk! need to do is keep it rolling and bring it full circle. I&#x27;ll be writing to. Any one who feels inspired can also submit illustrations for the story and I&#x27;ll include them to. Our story... our art... here at Nurk and a printed bond copy in yer mail box! The 5th of May is my birthday. I&#x27;ll be 30. I think this is an awesome project, for us all. So join in. Gird up yer wriiting loins and hit the wastes. This story can go anywhere, it&#x27;s been blowing up Schmooville for three years and poor Mort still hasn&#x27;t gotten his beer. So that&#x27;s the deal. Three good posts in the thread, perhaps an illustration of the action, and you get a nice bound copy of the illustrated, Secret Mort in the Winter Wonder Wasteland, in yer mailbox.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">So 15 days of Secret Mort left. Half way through this contest and folks here at Nurk! and PTM are looking kinda lame. But that&#x27;s nothing new. We&#x27;ve got some good posts from Comikaze and Pig Killer. Mr. Bitterman has posted some slick additions. That makes three... which is the usual number of participants we get at any Nurk! contest. So far it looks like I&#x27;m going to get off easy... only making one copy of the book for Comikaze... But I&#x27;m sure ya&#x27;ll will bust in at the last minute and prove me wrong. Keep posting Nurkites...</div>

I&#x27;d love to finish it and I think about it all the time but getting started again is the real fight. Thanks for showing interest that should help me get started.

The stories have no specific order although the first two are really helter skelter and don&#x27;t make much sense. But they are only like 2 pages long. They are just goofy. The Story from the forums Winter Wonder Wasteland is really long but it&#x27;s pretty fun to read, I think. I still want to finish that one too and it&#x27;s still a group project open to additions from anyone on the forums.</div>

This link is extremely interesting...

it goes to a Gamefaqs post (shown by photobucket) that has a dude who claims he has leaked info. He guessed the dragoon parts correctly before the update, which puts the rest of his information up for the possiblity of truth. He has a lot of good information and i think it may be trustworthy due to one correct assumption. Read his post and see for yourself.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">As far as everybody returning.

They already have them coded. There is no reason for them not to come back. Especially in the sense that &quot;The Wii is an overclocked Gamecube&quot;, sure they&#x27;ll be returning. No sense in taking anyone away, even if they suck like the Ice Climbers.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">I just messed around with some strength and aerobics at midnight withe the Wii.  So far the skiing balance games are pretty neat.  I managed to unlock the tight rope game and I was doing pretty amazing with that too.  Hurray!  

I&#x27;m also ranked &quot;bodybuilder&quot; in lunges (for strength training.)  Yes!  I am the Lunge Master!  

However my BMI is 26.5 or something and I guess I need to lose some pounds or at least convert the fat to muscle to be healthy.  The Wii says that people averaging a BMI of 22 are least likely to have health problems?  Crazy.  I&#x27;m 171 pounds and 6&#x27;3.  It considers me having a normal weight.    My Fitness Age was like 32 or something.  Yeah, I guess I need to get in shape.

My mom was ranked &quot;overweight&quot; but her age and her Fitness Age matched perfectly!  So I guess even though she&#x27;s overweight she&#x27;s where she is supposed to be.  Her BMI was pretty high though.  

I totally feel the burn guys.  This game is wack.  It&#x27;s fun though.  My balance sucks, but hey if it teaches me posture that&#x27;s cool.  It&#x27;s kind of scary having that mannequin-like trainer though, but ah well.  He&#x27;s helpful and cheers me on when I suck.

The Hula Hoop thing is ridiculous.  My mom totally pwned me on that.  I&#x27;m like, &quot;How do I spin my hips!  MY HIPS WEREN&#x27;T MADE FOR SPINNING!&quot;

Apparently my mom is a hula hoop fiend though.  They should have ranks like that, seriously.

So buy Wii Fit.   You&#x27;ll lose weight and you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve actually accomplished something.  

I think.</div>

Metaldrummer - Here&#x27;s a brief synopsis from the design document.

The setting is post apocalypse wasteland, “ The Savage Wastes”. The main playable character is Secret Mort. A young thug who likes drinkin’, shootin’, and racin’ around in modified slag wagons. He lives in a slapped together crap shack out in the wastes, where he generally hangs out on a crusty couch on  the front porch, with his crusty friends, Filthy Martin, Squishy Dave, and Scabby Chris, drinking beer, smoking weed, and shooting at mutants that wander into his yard. Then they all drive down to the local Chicken Bunker for some radioactive hotwings. This is the sweet life of Secret Mort. But like any young feller, adventure is always around the corner, for this wasteland is no ordinary radioactive desert. The blasted rock and shifting ash give way to mysterious swamps, mutant jungles, glowing ruins, barbarous shanty towns and anti-gravity mud forts inhabited by mad scientists and their armies of genetically altered cheerleaders. Secret Mort can’t even go into town on  a beer run without being chased by aliens, hustled by crackwhores, and shot at by renegade mafiosos, not to mention the pantsless ass monger cannibal, El Magnifico.

So the Mac OS port of Irrlicht is a jackass. You heard me. All versions of it. 1.0 however was the last one that was proven to work because it shipped with executable binaries, so it is the one we ran with.

Complete credit goes to James here who stayed up until 4am his local time making this work. While he was hammering away at that, I got our SVN setup. SVN right now is only being used for code version control, so only we three coders have access. Everybody else can use dotproject to track their files/assets.</div>

He says Mario is just a lame cartoon, while master chief is actually like human, and he is depicted better as a human. He&#x27;s so fu***** stupid, and i wanna tear his head off.

He also claims that Wii is a &quot;Fad&quot; and it&#x27;ll wear off by next month. WRONG. according to a dude at best buy, the Wii&#x27;s have been flying off the shelves the entire year it&#x27;s been released, and it really flying off shelves so near Christmas time this year.

I also know some Microsoft call of duty fan boy, who destroyed a Wii he somehow acquired by throwing it off of his roof. A dumbass if you ask me. A Wii is better than anything out there, and to judge it by its looks is stupid. Fuck anyone who uses the excuse &quot;Kiddy&quot; for any Wii game. GRAHHRHAHRHHARHARHAR

Sorry, he&#x27;s just been pissing me off. DAMN YOU MICROSOFT FAN BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2) Never trust anything &#x27;the guy&#x27; at best buy says. Ever. - This should be number one but I&#x27;m to lazy to renumber this list. Really I am.

3) The Wii sucks.

4) The Xbox, Xbox 360 and Microsoft all suck too.

5) Consoles, in general suck. 

For mindless shooting/action type games they are nice but for anything else they blow. They controls suck. Akward feeling, unintuitive and not enough buttons in logical places. Not to mention horrid menu systems that are annoying and user unfriendly. The PC is the place for anything rpg or close to rpg but these game developers keep trying to push everything over to console. 

I tried playing dead rising on the Xbox and I really wanted to love that game &#x27;cause I&#x27;m such a zombie freak. It was five days of pain for me, constantly dying due to the shitty play style of trying to use a controller that&#x27;s frankly unintuitive and menu driven crap. All the other games I&#x27;ve tried have been the same. The only thing remotely fun, is the shooters and those are still annoying.

What I&#x27;ve played of the Wii, which hasn&#x27;t been alot, hasn&#x27;t been much different.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">Technically the Wii is a fad.

So is the DS.

So is the PS3. And the 360. And the PS2. By their nature they are all fads. They go through the stages of new, popular, phenom, fad, and finally niche. There&#x27;s guys still playing Atari. They&#x27;ll be guys still playing the Wii.

But anyone calling the Wii a fad is scared. You know, I don&#x27;t know why the kids thing is a knock against Nintendo.

1) We, my generation at least, grew up playing games. We were kids, the games were for kids. We were teens, the games were for teens. Now we&#x27;re adults and you got shit like GTA, and Manhunt. Bloody violently terrible things. We grew up. The platform grew up. There were always odd games that broke that mold, but I find it&#x27;s held true. I sometimes look back, or I look on the shelf, and I try to decide what I would play if I were a kid. There ain&#x27;t much. So god bless Nintendo if they make kids games, that is a void that needs filled, for the kids sake.

2) So fucking what. Mario is so awesome, he fucked that dude&#x27;s mother, and Peach filmed it because she&#x27;s a freaky fuck princess like that. Mario Galaxy is awesome. Just because it&#x27;s a kids game doesn&#x27;t mean it ain&#x27;t fun. Fuck, I played all the way through Cookies and Cream.. a game that requires two players because it&#x27;s split vertically and you have to help each other solve puzzles so you can make it to the end gate together. It was gushy and colorful and lovey and sharey and carey.. that was a fucking kids game. I enjoyed it. I made Timmy enjoy it, so I could finish it. I don&#x27;t let predudice and ignorance get in the way of a fun game concept, or a new game.

Keep fighting the good fight, Kevin.</div>

I&#x27;m mouse and keyboard as much as any man... but the Wii changes things. Drastically.

And Wii does not suck sky dog, it actually has very good FPS controls, the new Medal of Honor for Wii game just came out and it got an 8.0/10 at gamespot, and they said it was a great game, especially with the Wii zapper.

And I was okay with dead risings&#x27; controls, they didn&#x27;t bother me that much. I don&#x27;t mind the dual analog control scheme much, but i&#x27;ll get used to the Keyboard/Mouse when i get The Orange Box for pc for Christmas (Hopefully)</div>

So this guy is pretty cool. I love the axe, but I think that&#x27;s probably obvious. I&#x27;m also not surprised that he looks rather similar to your avatar minus the mohawk. I think he works out with the combo high end body armor and home made weaponry. I&#x27;d like to see a little more wear and tear on the armor, like it&#x27;s saved his life a few times, and I would also like some knee pads. Dude needs some knee pads. His little knees all sitting out there unprotected, just waiting to get smashed by some rubble brats brick bat. I like this guy though. I want to see him in action with that axe. He also looks like the kinda guy who would wear a tooth or finger necklace. Maybe ears.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">Yeah, when I look at the torso I can&#x27;t help but place the armor somewhere between &quot;Fallout&#x27;s Leather Armor&quot; and &quot;Doom Guy.&quot; It&#x27;s probably the military green color which is bringing the Doom resemblance out of him.

He&#x27;s got a very intense neck region. He looks like the kind of guy who is prone to fucking snap.

But yeah, that axe for the fucking win.</div>

Subconscious inspiration for the win. I also see what you mean about his knees too. The eye is drawn right to them, like they&#x27;ve got big arrows pointing at them saying &#x27;BASH ME HERE&#x27;, heh. I&#x27;ll see what I can do to remedy that situation.

Bitterman, you&#x27;ve inspired me... again. Bringing up the leather armor from Fallout gave me a bit of a vision of adding some leather texture to areas of the armor. I&#x27;ll work on that along with the dings and bashes Skeller suggested for the next wip.

The axe is brutal isn&#x27;t it? I saw it and said &quot;that&#x27;s what Eddon uses to cleave through the dumbasses that get in his way.&quot;</div>

It looks like &quot;Combat Armor&quot; from Fallout.  But either way, it&#x27;s still pretty sweet.  Does he have a helmet?  

I don&#x27;t get why he just has a melee (spell check doesn&#x27;t have that word? weird  pugilism...it has pugilism, but not melee) weapon though and not like a flamethrower.  w00t kill some massive evil scorpions with that son of a gun.

But yeah.  I dig bald men in combat armor.  The guy looks like he&#x27;s ready to get medieval on many hineys.  I just hope it&#x27;s not mine.

and im filled with so much rage and hatred  ..

i feel like a dog in a cage thats been constantly been poked with a stick.

and its not directed towards that movie at all, 

infact i barely watched the thing so i cant tell you if it was good or not.

I spent the whole time imagining ways to murder this fat bitch behind me 

who couldnt seem to keep her mouth shut.

Im not one to pick fights , but im not one to take abuse either, so about half way in after another loud idiotic question, i turned around and kindly asked her to shut the fuck up.. unfortunately not in those words.

I was half hoping to insult her husband into a bloodthirsty hockey fight right there in the crowded theatre. 

unfortunately she shut up for a while but still couldnt help being her idiotic self, chiming in occasionally.. 

JEESUS ! 

whats wrong with human beings!@

next time im in a theatre and this happens screw caution screw politeness screw the threat of large jock boyfreinds, No ones talking in my damn movies! cautions going to the wind and people are going to shut up. 

theres so many fucking jerks out there, and worse there timid husbands that dont handle them (or vice versa) .. 

I wish this was the middle ages where I could just slap the wench then cleave the idiot next to her, for not having the nerve to tell her to shut up.

...............

Phew... 

okay just wanted to all get that anger out of my head,..

feel much better now, no murderous rampages tommarow... i swear.

im sure these kinds of things have pissed you off too,

whens the last time this kinda thing happend where you felt like thinning out the population?</div>

                    <div class="post-content">Yeah, that shit enrages me. I stopped going to the theater for years because of that. Somebody was always kicking the back of my seat, or coughing on me or talking or stinking, it impossible to enjoy a movie under those circumstances. Luckily they invented DVD. But I like watching movies on the big screen. So I devised a plan. I goto matinees. During the week... or if I have to go at night I go on a Monday. I never set foot in a theater on a weekend or anywhere near opening night. I might really want to see the movie bad... but I know I&#x27;ll get hosed... so I wait. No one ever goes to a matinee on a tuesday. You basically get the whole theater to yourself. If you dont have the luxury of being able to goto movies during a weekday try a sunday morning matinee. It wont be as vacant but I find most of the loud obnoxious inconsiderate fuck holes and their sticky fingered hell spawn children who seem to enjoy ruining your movie experience are at church during that time.

Sorry your movie got crapped on. I really want to see it. Did you get to see any of it? What did you think? I really like Eli Roth&#x27;s directing. Although I hate the fact Quentin Tarantino doesnt make movies anymore he just goes around sticking his name to other peoples shit. Rereleasing old movies under his label and such. What a wanker. I&#x27;ve always really liked his work. But this one time I rented some anime and there was an intro by Quentin, basically stating how he was responsible for anime being in the US and how he knows so much more about it than anyone else... blah blah blah... I fucking hate that. I was watching Miyazaki movies in 1980... fuck you Quentin Tarantino!</div>

&quot;Nope.&quot;

That&#x27;s why the death of the drive in was such a disappointment. You could talk all you fucking wanted to, it was in your car. It didn&#x27;t matter. You just had to put up with people leaning on their car horn.

Which is probably worse than talking.

                    <div class="post-content">You should have been sitting with me at Phantom of the Opera.  Even the theatrical scene is getting marred by idiots.  On one end I had this girl making out with her boyfriend.  Then in between that they&#x27;d start talking.  During intermission the girl who was wearing one of those easy to snag kind of elasti pants that ride at your hips or just below started pulling them up.  PULLING THEM UP!  When they go below your hips from starters, I don&#x27;t think you have to worry about a wedgie, you know? 

Ah well.  I don&#x27;t know what they were doing, I don&#x27;t want to guess.  Point is, it&#x27;s disgusting and they pay 50 some dollars just to do it when they could do it in their own home. 

On the other side of me was Megan.  She didn&#x27;t do anything annoying (she just snickered everytime I made faces of angst), but the guy beside her who correct me in pronouncing Dumar as in Alexander Dumar (course I just might be spelling it wrong, aaaargh) ended up getting sloshed after intermission.  When he came back he kept whistling and sighing a whole lot.  So there you have it.  Even the english professor types aren&#x27;t behaved enough to watch a musical.

And then my problem...

When you watch the movie version of Phantom of the Opera, I think it kind of spoils you.  When you&#x27;re doing a movie you can make it perfect because even if people make a mistake you can always do it again.  But when you see it performed...you only get to see it once, one shot, to see if they get it right.

I think that that is supposed to be what makes the stage so great.  It&#x27;s a lot harder to do everything perfect in one take and that&#x27;s what these people do.

But the glint and glamour of the movie still ruined the stage performance for me.  I don&#x27;t know why.  I guess before seeing the movie you should be able to appreciate how great it is done live first.  And then watch the movie.  Maybe then it enhances you&#x27;re love for the show.

I liked it.  But I didn&#x27;t love it.  I didn&#x27;t stare at it in wide-eyed wonder.  When I saw L</div>

This isn&#x27;t so bad at first... but the entire event is like 4 hours. It starts at like 7 and ends at 11. This husband and wife have brought their children ages 2,4 and 6. They really want to hear the symphany... I&#x27;m sure. So the kids spend the whole time climbing over each other and talking and fucking around. Everytime the manage to get settled down the mother starts messing with them and soon they are jumping all around again. So soon it is way after the tykes bed time and they start crying and generally being even worse than before. Everyone in the surrounding 3 rows is pissed off and glaring at them and they don&#x27;t take the kids out or do anything but sit their like fucking idiots as their children screech during a musical score.

                    <div class="post-content">Okay so I go to the theater and im sitting there watching Land of the Dead, allright?

Lights dim, people behind me at are still talking, okay whatever it&#x27;s previews.

They&#x27;re still talking...the opening starts, and i swear to god, no sooner had they displayed GEORGE REMERO&#x27;S LAND OF THE DEAD on the screen, when that stupid bitch behind me, turned to her friends and asked.

&quot;I got strawberry, whatd you guys get?&quot;  &quot;I got apple&quot;  &quot;I got rasberry&quot;  &quot;I&#x27;ll trade you a strayberry for an apple one&quot;  &quot;what kinda drinks did you guys get?&quot;

I turned around and said &quot;How about you be quiet?  the movie is starting&quot;

She looks at me and is like &quot;EXCUUUUSE me?  Oh I know you didnt just go there.&quot;

I shit you not.

Then, after constantly talking through the whole goddamn movie (there was no way in hell to move, the place was packed) for fucking christ&#x27;s sake, a CELLPHONE RINGS.  I am going holy christ who the fuck&#x27;s phone is it calling durring a mo-  No sooner could I finish my thought, when the bitch behind me turns on a blue light, which i realize is her cellphone.  She answers.

&quot;Oh hey girl whats happenin?  Not much, I&#x27;m just watching a movie.  Oh yeah?  Where you guys at?&quot;

Thats it, thats the last straw, I wanted to turn around, and i grab her goddam cellphone, and i threw it out the door of the theater, as hard as I could, and the goddamn people in front of me would have clapped.

I hate people like that. hate hate hate.</div>

Come on, we are POISON dammit!  The next time you guys go to a movie, orchestra, or theater, dont tollerate shit from assholes.

You see somebody talking on a cellphone, you grab that cellphone, and you put it inside your soda pop like an icecube.

Somebody behind you is talking to the screen, you turn around and make an ass of the lady, by explaining to her like she&#x27;s a retard, that the people on the screen cant hear her.

Some little bastard children in front of you are messing around, you do exactly what I did one time.  You say to the mother &quot;You will either get these little bastards to sit still and be quiet, leave the theater, or I will have the manager throw your ass out the theater.&quot;

and last, but not least.  The next fucking asshole you see smoking a ciggerett in the theater (that is what pissed me off the most) you go and get a big cup of water from the main table, (not soda so you dont get everything sticky), walk up, and drench the fucker.</div>

&quot;Oh my god he&#x27;s got a can of stella, oh my god how did he get that in?&quot;

I stand up, turn around, grab a shoe off each foot resting on the back of the chairs either side of me and throw them in to the aisle, they stand up to complain and I simply lean forward, whisper to them, &quot;Be quiet and get your feet off the chairs or I&#x27;ll drag you out of the seats.&quot;

They said nothing afterwards and even left after 45 minutes.

                    <div class="post-content">I don&#x27;t think it is Darwinism Inverse, I think the problem is more along the lines of trying to protect what seems right. Bitterman does say that we become the jerks if we do something.  It&#x27;s true.

But you know, making people angry just makes them even more annoying.  We can&#x27;t wipe out all of the anger, so we figure we&#x27;re being the better person by not doing anything.  

You know what would be a better movement? If everytime someone talked through the theater, all the people who were upset left and got their money back.  I mean if a couple people do it here or there, no one will care, but if EVERYBODY did.  Man, that&#x27;d really force people to start spying in the theaters.  Walking down with cattle prods, having Hitler youth rat on their parents for making too much noise while eating popcorn.

There will be extreme measures in order to silence everyone so that they can enjoy the film.

Maybe people just need to realize that the universe doesn&#x27;t exist for them and that they should go to school to learn how to be a human being and not some apathetic moron who loves society only because other people do, and doesn&#x27;t know how to reason that people have a good reason to be mad at them, not the other way around. 

Kindergarteners everywhere should learn how to be human beings.  If they make a mistake, teacher slugs them in the face.  If they get caught picking on some kid, the kid slugs &#x27;em in the face.  If the kid is being picked on, he&#x27;s offered a Glock to blow the kids skull apart.  If a kid chooses to use it on the kid for his lunch money, well hey...it&#x27;s a dog-eat-dog-world.  

And man...Darwin&#x27;s world would really suck when all of the jerks like us are the first to go.  Cause I think the thinkers of the world are the ones that hate.

But they&#x27;re smart enough to realize that they cannot even chip at the fossiled mountain of crap that has become the world.

So we can&#x27;t even slap the kids around when they can&#x27;t pass their puzzle pages in right.

                    <div class="post-content">Let&#x27;s get serious here now, you&#x27;re all talk, talk, I would do this I would do that. Let me tell you something gross, in terms of Pop Culture.

I went to see Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I want to add also that I don&#x27;t go to movies a lot unless I really want to see a movie and this triology in particular caught my attention.

I went to see the premier, on Mexico, it was full as fly over shit. Lines were long as hell and I even prepared myself for it, I knew it was going to be hell. After like four hours of waiting I got my pre-bought ticket, which I got weeks ago, and went in with a cousin and her friend. We sit down, the place is full to hell and the heat is incredible and bealieve me I&#x27;m not to be fucked with when I&#x27;m overheated, even with cold soda.

Previews pass and all, after about 30 minutes, when shit is getting good this bitch Nextel, a radio cellphones, starts making BEEP BEEP, and I&#x27;m like, &quot;You fucking stupid bitch&quot;, and I see he&#x27;s just in front of me, fucking hell. She starts babbling and the annoying BEEP BEEP sound keeps coming from the fucking radio and people start to whistle, as usual the guys from the Theater don&#x27;t do shit.

I tell her, &quot;Please, could you tune it down or something&quot; and the bitch didn&#x27;t answer and keep babbling and babbling. I tell her again five minutes later, &quot;Hey, could you put that thing in cell mode, I&#x27;m trying to watch the movie&quot;

The bitch turns around and tells me, &quot;What do you care about this lame movie?&quot; and my brain felt like if someone had injected pure NOS into my ciculatory system. I stand up and yell, &quot;What do I care about your lame Nextel&quot;. I take the fucking phone, open it, smash it in half with my knee and throw it at the asshole taking a watch at the door from anyone getting in and he&#x27;s all clueless at what happened. The bitch, and his fat boyfriend which I haven&#x27;t seen, raised up and began to yell at me and they stopped the movie and lights went on.

&quot;Hey what&#x27;s going on&quot; Yells one of the theater gu</div>

Plus it doesn&#x27;t help the T.V. immortalizes stupid people for doing stupid things, thus infecting more people ten fold.

Sad thing is, there is about only one way to deal with the stupids, and when you do that your looked down on by everyone else. Bitterman was right about a society built to protect the stupid and weak from the strong.

I remember when I went to see Serenity, as the movie started there was a woman in the audience who actually started calling people on her cell phone and telling them she was at the movie and not to call her...  Did she not realise that she could, I dunno, TURN IT OFF and therefore it would not ring?  Or *gasp* leaving it in the car?  

But I was too busy laughing at her to be mad.  I mean, I think she was trying to do the right thing... but she was going about it all ass-backwards...

Anyhow, that&#x27;s just my two cents.</div>

On the other hand, if the problem were truly as bad and rampant, we&#x27;d have killed everyone and every thing by now. In short, restraint and personal responsibility makes us human. The lion feels no remorse for killing you. A human may. I agree with Keen this assertion.

On some mythical third hand, I&#x27;m out of practice. And I haven&#x27;t posted on this blog I host with some friends of mine in ages. I made a post today. I felt it relevant to this thread&#x27;s interests. I agree with myself on my own assertion.

My first day with my first character went like this...

Started out as a 1st lvl cop. Walked around. Saw a Zombie. Took a shot at it. I missed. Moved on. Looted a junk yard and found a length of pipe and a fireaxe. Sweet. I moved and looted a few more buildings but found nothing of interest. I saw like two more zombies. I went into a strongly fortified police station and meet like 15 other people. Safe inside I went to sleep. End of day.

I started a second character. A soldier. Walked a bit saw a zombie. Got cocky and blasted at him till I was out of ammo. He wasn&#x27;t dead yet and two more zombies had shown up. One took a bite outta me. Luckily it wasnt the infectious kinda. I ran. Ran right into 7 zombies in a clump. Ran some more. Found 10 zombies. Crap! I was running out of action points and had no place to hide. I ran into a random building and just closed all the doors. Now Im in a regular old building with only closed doors and windows between me and the zombies. I&#x27;m a bit worried. Any basically text based game that makes me worry and stay alittle scared even when I not playing it is awesome. Although I do have a bit of an overactive imagination. But still. I love this game.

On that note. I&#x27;m off to help set up for the zombie internatrional ping pong tournament and party!

Peace!</div>

I did find a flare gun and I see flares going off all the time. But I not sure if they mark safe houses or zombie infestation. So I stay away from them. 

My characters are:

Dan Hessel - military - lvl1 - currently in Dentonside at the Horsey Square fire station (92,54). We need gas for our generator. 

and...

Ken Finnley - cop - lvl1 - currently in Pitneybank. Sheltering at Boutcher Alley Police Department.

Although the Giddings mall was the scene of a giant 300+ zombie seige and massacre, it seems Pitneybank has a realtively low zombie population right now. But Dentonside and Starlingtown to the north are totally mobbed up.

Lets all try and meet up somewhere and start our own gang and safe house.</div>

Walk, walk, walk, enter a building, search, nothing, leave, walk walk, walk, spot a zombie, walk, walk, shoot miss, shoot miss, shoot miss, shoot miss, shoot hit for 1 pt of damage, shoot miss, shoot miss, shoot miss, shoot miss, shoot miss,... well you get the point and my guy was a soldier.

I thought it sucked so I never mentioned it. I almost started again when I read up on it again over on HpotD but then there was a lot of talk about the Something Awful guys playing hordes of zombies and slaughtering all the players so I figured I wouldn&#x27;t bother.

Maybe I&#x27;ll try again.</div>

By the way here&#x27;s another one for ya people which has this little like... eastern feel, hence the name Ost which means East in German.

And also here&#x27;s one I made for Carnage and his RME project. This has a more Jazzy feel to it so enjoy.

Edit:

After an hour of playing around I finished this. It clocks around 4:30 which is the longest I&#x27;ve produced so far. Kinda inspired by the Kingdom Cole thing. Shortly I&#x27;ll have a short story depicting what is the song about, stay tuned for it.</div>

It sounds so fucking dirty the distortion is horrible, at least it sounds better than the integrated distortion, what I fucking need is a 100 Watt Head Ibañez or Spider II, maybe even a fucking Crate or Marshall. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m opening my &quot;Buy Vico Surge the Correct Instrument&quot; Fund so I can get some decent shit! And it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m cheap but I hate having to pay 500 bucks for an Amp I can find at 250 on San Diego but my fucking currency is so shitty it ain&#x27;t worth a fuck when trying to get some decent equipment.

Correction. I now have in my possesion a 45 Watts Squire Amp and I can say now I&#x27;m fully satisfied with it. Yamaha ain&#x27;t worth shit and here&#x27;s why. The not so tiny 25 Watt Yamaha Amp needed to be at volume level 5 ot 6 for the Distortion to have a good tone even when the distortion itself is at level 8! And the horrible thing is that the fucking thing was about to crack, I could hear pops and crackles every once in a while, so I was getting real pissed. Now with the Squire it&#x27;s a whole different story. This baby is barelly at Level 1 with the Distortion in 9 and I&#x27;m getting blown the fuck away with the power of the speaker. This baby rocks! I don&#x27;t hear any pops or crackles anymore and the only problem it has is the main port for the guitar which seems to be damaged, I noticed when I had to move the cable all around until I could hear a clean noise, but who cares for 70 bucks!

Check out the link, sorry for the size of the pic but my camera blows, to check out what I&#x27;m working with! For those who can&#x27;t make it out, and probably most won&#x27;t make it out, there&#x27;s a copy of a Strat Guitar, Sunrise Model, the Squire 45 Watts and a Danelectro Black Coffee Distortion (Wake up and smell the coffee... they weren&#x27;t joking about that one). Plus all the cables and on the background an old non-working PC which I plan to fix to use as a third recording platform.

I think it&#x27;s just a DLL in a zip. Extract it to a common area like C:\Windows\System32\

Or stick it in the Audacity folder, C:\Program Files\Audacity 1.3 Beta\

                    <div class="post-content">Oh. Hell. Yes.

I try to go to the official web site at least once a week. Someone and I were discussing the lack of updates, or not putting stuff on the site we already know (like Solid Snake being a fighter even though he doesn&#x27;t have a page yet).

But I explained it like this. When I was running the site for WL2042, we setup a schedule for weapons updates. Every Thursday, new weapon revealed, new shot of it, new blurb. Not much, but we kept a beat to it, set our watch to it. Soon I didn&#x27;t even had to put out the announcement, every Thursday 10,000 people showed up on the site wanting to know where the weapon was at.

That is the kind of regularity they&#x27;re setting up here, and it&#x27;s effective. They&#x27;ve probably got all the updates pre-metered out to take them right up to the release day.

But yeah, playing this one is going to be awesome, especially if they stick to the online play. If they drop it I will never forgive them.

And still buy it because I&#x27;m a sucker.</div>

I guess some of you may not be as hardcore oldschool rpg fans as some of us, but Earthbound is one of my favorites.  For some of you that may or may not know, the character Ness was added into Smash Bros. Melee.  Ness, the striped shirt and cap wearing, baseball bat toting teenager is the main character of the game Earthbound.  Throughout Earthbound, Ness developes a special psychic attack that only he can cast, it damages all enemies and deals insane ammounts of damage.

Devs from Melee were quoted to say that they removed this trademark move of Ness because it was too powerful to be used in-game.

If these smash balls allow for an ultra powerful finale attack...Ness just might be able to use...

But to those of you who don&#x27;t know who I&#x27;m talking about, Boshi was a character in Super Mario RPG : Legend of the Seven Stars.

I see it as a possibility, and it&#x27;d be easy to import the model into the game (like Link from twilight princess) but the problem at hand is what would his fighting style do?

Basically it would consist of a Dash attack (Fox + Falco from SSBM),
a samus Screw Attack, maybe go into a Rolling Spin Mode (Basically morph ball Samus), and a Spin-Launch attack (Which would basically be copying Jiggly Puff&#x27;s move from SSBM).

As the possibility of GETTING him to be a character, that&#x27;d be no problem.  As the PRACTICALITY of him being unique enough in moves for the game?  Doubtful.  He&#x27;d be a clone copy-char and in his place they could insert some other character from some other game.</div>

He&#x27;s no fucking clone. He&#x27;s got a slide move, he can jump.

That isn&#x27;t even counting accessories to his crimes; He&#x27;s got Beat. Eddy. Rush.

You see that? You see Wario? He&#x27;s riding a motorcycle. As a move. It can be stolen. And let&#x27;s talk about Wario. A character who is a generic smash and clobber platformer from the GBA, turned into Micro Game mogul with Warioware. And you know what? They found a way to make him work. We could dispute his moves or lack there of, but he&#x27;s right there. You know what Mario is famous for? Jumping. Yet he somehow also has a nice arsenal of moves. Don&#x27;t you give me no shit about Mega Man won&#x27;t work, Mega Man can&#x27;t do this. Mega Man can kick your ass, that&#x27;s what he can do. And we&#x27;re not even talking about X, who can dash and wall cling and is best friends with Zero and his crazy ass light sabre, we&#x27;re just talking regular old school Mega Man.

                    <div class="post-content">Alright it&#x27;s now time to officially announce the first annual Nurk fiction contest. I&#x27;m not sure what this means really as I just developed it and the adjectives &quot;first&quot; and &quot;annual&quot; make it sound a whole lot better than what it is; however, first and foremost this is all in good fun.

Some of you may come in here wanting to get your greedy little paws on the prizes. Well in case you are wondering what the prizes are before you get your greedy little paws on them I&#x27;ll tell you.

Prizes:

Grand Prize: The Omega Man - One of the more popular post apocalyptic movies which stars Charlton Heston. 

1st Runner up: One pack of anti-radiation (iodide pills) to keep you from getting thyroid cancer in case of nuclear attack.

2nd Runner up: The first Deathlands novel: Pilgrimage to Hell by Jack Adrian

Now for the guidelines:

A lot of the post apocalyptic stories I&#x27;ve read recently have always had a dark, depressing ending to them. Characters are always brooding and it&#x27;s understandable why they feel this way. They&#x27;re knee deep in hell so to speak. 

While I don&#x27;t want writers to make a happy go lucky wasteland adventure I&#x27;m going to offer up a very small challenge to kick up this contest (and the challenges will get harder with each contest). I want you all to have a happy ending. 

Perhaps we have a character who has always wanted to pledge his undying love for another, but for reasons out of his control (man vs nature, man vs man, man vs himself, man vs machine) he finds himself failing to do so. Maybe he&#x27;s given one last chance to prove his love or to simply show it and that&#x27;s what the story revolves around.

Or maybe we have a tale about a paradisaic utopia inside a government vault where people have made peace with themselves. They&#x27;ve become mild mannered, loving, and are very kind. But there is something that poses a threat to them and to their order and they must develop a way to either cover up this horrible secret, stop it, or allow it to consume them altogether. Bu</div>

                    <div class="post-content">Alrighty I&#x27;ll tackle both questions at once. I thought about answering them, but then I started to think about how much I hated high school essays and how restrictive they were.

First and foremost I have always hating having to have 800 word essay or a two page paper on blah blah blah. I mean when I&#x27;m writing something how am I supposed to know how long it is? And when I do write something I consider everything that is there worth being there and I hate getting rid of stuff just because someone doesn&#x27;t want to read it.

My answer for length is that I want a short story. I don&#x27;t want any novels and I certainly don&#x27;t want a two paragraph story unless of course you can really get your point across with those two paragraphs. And just because you may submit something that&#x27;s 15 pages doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that you&#x27;ll win because it&#x27;s long. Quality over quantity as they always say.

As for the universe well again I don&#x27;t want to restrict anyone.  If they want to write something about Fallout, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be to happy about it, but you know what? If it&#x27;s a good Fallout fiction then fine. I would really like to have some original fiction though as I had highlighted in the example scenarios.  

So lets see...don&#x27;t make my eyeballs explode with a novel or novella length story and try to be original. I suppose that&#x27;s the answer all summed up in a setence. Don&#x27;t you want to kill me for making you read everything above?</div>

Hmmm I just love sugar high. 

You know...just for the record, the Pilgrimage to Hell book is the original version printed in 1986. I don&#x27;t know if there was ever a reprint or not, but these books were gotten used. So don&#x27;t poke any fingers at me and say, &quot;LOCKE READ IT FIRST! WHAT A BLOODY FREAK!&quot; 

Because actually I bought two. And from what I&#x27;ve been reading of my own copy, the book is faaaaabulous to say in a none homosexual way. Er wait.</div>

As for Prilgrimage to Hell, it was reprinted but a first print isn&#x27;t exactly an easy find 18 years later  Took a few months for my wife to dig me up one over the net. Not that it&#x27;s valuable but if you are a post-apocalypse geek like me it&#x27;s pretty cool to have.</div>

                    <div class="post-content">I&#x27;m also looking for the remake and the original Gamma World books. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with Gamma World, it was a post apocalyptic pnp role playing game.

Wizards of the Coast made a remake of Gamma World using their Alternity game, but, as the cover says, it&#x27;s stand alone. Since I don&#x27;t have a credit card, I don&#x27;t use Ebay which is making things even more difficult to find.

I suppose I could just get the original which would be cooler, but I was thinking about it for a future prize.  If we get lots of good work then we&#x27;ll have better prizes.

But really...I&#x27;m starting to wonder if there should be some sort of donation system or something developed for prizes. I mean being a college student I&#x27;m certainly not made of money, and regardless if you&#x27;re in college, high school, or are in the working field, who is?  I would hope that most of us, as post apocalyptic fans would put a big thumbs down to materialism, but you never know.

Still...I don&#x27;t see any monthly contests in the future for Nurk. I suppose season contacts could be realistic, but the real problem, in my opinion, would be shipping things off the continent to Europe and the like.

I remember Ashmodai of the Fallout Network having some company send me Warcraft 3 Collector&#x27;s Edition. Once it came to me I mailed it to Germany, where he lives. And he paid me back and all that, but he also had to pay some sort of fee just for getting the package! I think overall he paid some 200 dollars for the stupid game. I asked him if it was worth it. It never is.

So really...it&#x27;s just something to think about.  Entrust Bitterman with donation money, I say, and then we show him what we want and he buys it.  It is HIS site afterall and if we can&#x27;t trust him then, heck, why are we here? Hehe.  And with donations and all that it&#x27;d be easier to get better prizes.

Who knows perhaps someday we&#x27;ll even be able to give away an Israeli gas mask or an infant radiation suit (which I&#x27;ve located by the way)! And the infant radiatio</div>

Mess with the best, end up like the rest..  some poor raider saps who thought they could take us in PnP.

-Dune Shark-

It originaly has a plow and 2 LMG mounts but i took them off so you could see it better from the angle it&#x27;s sitting.  the engine feeds the chains through the pipes in the sides to the rear axle so the back wheel is the one pushing everything.

-&quot;Battle&quot; Cruiser-

The first vehicle i ever tried to shade with shadow, and i think i did a fairly okay job...  Its a small cruise ship...very small, and the black things on the platforms are Browning M2s.  Also, it says on the side... N.Y. CRUISE LINES   but it&#x27;s written accross a door, which is slid open accross the other letter, sorry for the confusion.

A vanishing point is just a determined point on the horizon that everything diminishes to (things get smaller as they go back in space and what not). &quot;Gridding the space&quot; is just laying out a grid that diminishes to the vanishing point, just a little field to work on to keep things lined up and going back at the correct angles.

A ground plane is just a piece of ground to set the car on 

Do a search on the net for &quot;perspective drawing&quot; to get a nice illustrated idea of what I mean if that didn&#x27;t clear it up (and it probably didn&#x27;t). If I can get around to doing my own entry I&#x27;ll make sure to scan the roughs when the grid and vanishing point lines are all prominant and visible for you.

It&#x27;s definatly a very usefull skill to have in the illustration world, so if it&#x27;s something you tackle in 9th grade (freshman year of highschool ey?) then more power to ya.</div>

                <strong>AmmoJack</strong>: man, nothings worse than when a melody hits you in the shower and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it until you get out and get a guitar in your hands...and I hate playing with damp hands...

The song sounds pretty bitchin&#x27;, you have a nice thick tone going on too. It&#x27;d be nice to see it taken to the next level with some bass, drums, and vocals.

...&quot;monsters crawling from the earth, reaching skyward stagger forth
in their hands clutch bloody flesh, marching on they reek of death

one by one we all succumb, to the disease consuming every one
we must escape this undead madness, lest the shambling masses kill us all&quot;

...yeah...

            <div class="comment">
                <strong>Captain Carnage</strong>: I was using my fancy audio program to change around with some songs, when I started getting interested in the tempo and pitch managers.  I started experimenting around with a bunch of songs and by changing the pitch and restoring the tempo I was able to make the vocals (singers) sound like different people, and even different genders.

I was editing Ghost Riders by The Outlaws when I came accross a magic number (I tihnk it was 26% pitch down) that turned the singer...into Chef from South Park.

Good Times.

Mixed them together with photomatix and you got a shot that has the best highlights and the best shadows all in one =)  The reason it is so fuzzy is because of the the fact I had to take five different shots...  And it was a windy day...  So lots of movement.  I tried to reduce it as much as I can though =b

                <strong>Edipo</strong>: Something weird you might notice here is that there are no frets, fretless basses do exist and they are supposed to give the player a more experimental and artistic sound, also the tuning knobs look a little out of place. They are kinda out of place and the top of the neck is almost impossible to reach but the knobs are actually still usable because the strings go around the back of the neck... which actually makes it more impossible to play the first frets but fuck it. Enjoy!

                <strong>AmmoJack</strong>: I dig the body art, but from a musician&#x27;s standpoint the design is pretty impractical. Main points are the fretboard, which goes all the way to the bridge, which not only wouldn&#x27;t be accessable for playing, but also blocks any space for pickups and the tuning pegs working the way they do, which would cause for a mega heavy head (for gnarly neck dive) and also likely heavy tuning instability with a lot of string breaks from the heavy pressure at the nut....looks cool as hell though, I&#x27;d just like to see the idea applied to a second more realistic body/neck design!
