                    <strong>Sanctusorium</strong>: Its HDR photography.  Basically, its five different exposures of the same tree combined.  Two underexposed, two over, and one just right.  Mixed them together with photomatix and you got a shot that has the best highlights and the best shadows all in one =)  The reason it is so fuzzy is because of the the fact I had to take five different shots...  And it was a windy day...  So lots of movement.  I tried to reduce it as much as I can though =b

                    <strong>Edipo</strong>: Something weird you might notice here is that there are no frets, fretless basses do exist and they are supposed to give the player a more experimental and artistic sound, also the tuning knobs look a little out of place. They are kinda out of place and the top of the neck is almost impossible to reach but the knobs are actually still usable because the strings go around the back of the neck... which actually makes it more impossible to play the first frets but fuck it. Enjoy!

                    <strong>AmmoJack</strong>: I dig the body art, but from a musician's standpoint the design is pretty impractical. Main points are the fretboard, which goes all the way to the bridge, which not only wouldn't be accessable for playing, but also blocks any space for pickups and the tuning pegs working the way they do, which would cause for a mega heavy head (for gnarly neck dive) and also likely heavy tuning instability with a lot of string breaks from the heavy pressure at the nut....looks cool as hell though, I'd just like to see the idea applied to a second more realistic body/neck design!

The song sounds pretty bitchin', you have a nice thick tone going on too. It'd be nice to see it taken to the next level with some bass, drums, and vocals.

..."monsters crawling from the earth, reaching skyward stagger forth
in their hands clutch bloody flesh, marching on they reek of death

one by one we all succumb, to the disease consuming every one
we must escape this undead madness, lest the shambling masses kill us all"
