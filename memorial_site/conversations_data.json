I used the pill bottle you mentioned and a few peices of that pink foam insulation, some masonite and some phone wiring I found in the dirt.

Correct me if I'm wrong but Activision and Blizz were already owned by Vivendi so this is more of an internal money swap that makes a new company? Meh. More mega mergers to increase stock prices, while nothing new really happens so the consumer just gets more of the same old shit in a new wrapper.",

Since the Executives from Activision are taking over the reigns the wealth and power along with the good name of Blizzard ( well known to the billions of people in Asia through WoW) they will begin producing tons of new console games and someplace in there they will need level designers. \n\nhttp://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_i ... tory=16458",

      "content": "you guys are crazy paranoid...\n\nIt's been semi broken down, but I'll do it again (more simply)\n\nVivendi Universal Games (VUG) is a big publisher...they are worldwide and do a bunch of games\n\nVUG owns Sierra. (Kings Quest, Space Quest, HL1, HL2, etc...been around since the 80's) They also own Blizzard, who was once many years ago an independent developer\n\nActivision is another large publisher, they mostly make rehashes of old games, licensed games, and sequels. (then again how many games have Blizzard made in their entire history that weren't either a sequel, expansion, or offshoot of an existing IP? Oh that's right, none.)\n\nActivision merged with VUG, and for whatever reason decided to rename themselves Activision Blizzard, while keeping Sierra Games a separate division of the company, continuing to focus on the publishing of games from independent developers.\n\nThe most obvious benefit that can been seen from this is that Vivendi is associated with (possibly owns...I forget) Universal Music. Activision owns/makes Guitar Hero. Hmm...massive library of music to access? check.\n\nOther benefits include a company that is now worth 18.7 BILLION dollars that has a history of actually giving a shit about independent developers making new titles. The bigger the wallet the publisher has, the way huger the budget every game can get. \n\nVivendi (was, now is Sierra Games...same difference) our publisher, and they have treated us like gold. Actually, gold doesn't get treated as good as we do. I don't know about any other developers they are working with, but I can personally say they have been extremely kind to us (and definitely not cheap with us.)\n\nSo don't get your knickers in a twist. Every thing's fine.\n\n(sorry I got to this late (apparently) been at work late kicking asses and taking names)",

Well folks, I'm here to tell you about something new, something special. This holiday season, your favorite website and forums, Poison the Mind, will be bringing you to a whole new level of joy. This year we will be hosting a (not so) Secret Santa Holiday Gift Exchange Extravaganza. That's right folks free presents, from the folks at PTM to the folks at PTM. So sign up now (deadline for sign up is October 10th). PM me your name and mailing address to be added to the list. Then on October 11th I'll mix up all the names in a hat and randomly pull them out and match them up. Then the magic begins. Everyone who is participating gets a name and address of a fellow PTM member and buys, makes, or steals them an awesome present they would especially enjoy. Next, they wrap it up, and then mail it off anytime in December before Christmas. People who have to mail things really far may need to send out theirs earlier. Then right around X-mas everyone who has signed up will get a sweet present from their best pals at PTM. So if your not a stingy cheap ass fuck face sign up now, and let the magic of the holidays fill your heart!",

Word on the street is they (the whole company judges via inter-office forum poll) tend to favor costumes of existing and at least moderately well known characters. Now, these people are nerds, so game/comic/cartoon/old action movie references shouldn't be a problem.\n\nI'd like to do something that works with my existing \"look\" (most notably the long hair since that's a pain to work around) if possible.\n\nTo give you an idea of my competition Dusty was a fully 3d mario bro's Piranha Plant (fully sphereical plant head and warp pipe and everything, think mario rpg style) made mostly of cardboard, papermache and paint.\n\nCurrent ideas include:\n\n-Snake Plisskin - awesome character, but might make for a less impressive costume\n-Beyond The Grave (Gungrave) - kind of obscure and would be a lot of work\n-Alucard (Hellsing) - eh...anime...too overdone plus lots of fabric work\n\nSo yeah...any long haired badasses you can think of?\n\nMy friend/coworker is going to be the Vault Dweller, so something fallout related would be awesome, but I cant think of anyone awesome from the game that had anything other than a buzzcut (Ian, Cassidy)\n\nI have also considered being a custom misc post apoc badass, but that might loose votes for the contest...",

      "content": "hangovers just come from the dehydration you get from drinking alcohol. The alcohol acts as a diuretic, which is why when you drink booze you have to pee a lot more than when drinking non-alcoholic beverages. Basically all the water just passes through your system without being taken into the body for appropriate use, so even though you're drinking liquids consisting of 80% water you're not getting anything out of it.\n\nAs such, the best (and nearly perfect, as long as you don't drink too much, too much being enough to make you puke or pushing the limits around that area) way to avoid getting a hangover is to drink water after you finish drinking for the night. Try to wait until the alcohol has passed through your system a little (so that the diuretic effect is as weak as possible) and then drink several glasses of water before going to bed. You'll want to drink maybe one glass of water for every 3 or so beers (or equivalent amounts of alcohol). After a certain point though the amount of water you need to recover for the damage done by the alcohol becomes some what exponential though, and as such can eventually become impossible to avoid a hangover. That said though, you should always try your best anyway, because any amount of water put back into your system is better than none.\n\nOh, and coffee, soda, and tea will only make it worse, as those will only further dehydrate you. The reason that mixing with juice would seem to worsen the effect is because juices are high in sugar (natural or otherwise) and sugar will also aid in the dehydration process.\n\nThis information is from science (glorious glorious science, where would we be without you?) by the way, not just random personal experiments, however I have never known someone who has had poor results with the method.",

We thought about getting some movies, eating some candy, but other than that the plan seemed somewhat dull.  I brought up the idea that maybe we could get some dry ice and make some fog, or put it ontop of the fridge so it billows down to the floor.  That's how the conversation derailed a bit, and we started talking about dry ice and pressure and about half an hour later we both decided it was a great idea.\n\nWe were going to build a \"steam\" engine that ran on dry ice.\n\nNow, the first thing we had to do was ask the RA (Residential Advisor) here at the college dorms if dry ice was violating any of the forbidden materials rules.  I went up to her room and asked her about the dry ice probably for halloween and possibly for a side project that Jason and I were thinking about.\n\nShe honestly had no idea, so she called her supervisor friend.\n\nHe had no idea and told her to call the Housing Director.\n\nShe called the Housing Director and she had no idea, and said to call her higher-up.\n\n So apparently I asked something that nobody has thought of before, and they had to bounce around all over the higher ups in the college until some guy came to our apartment and told jason (at the same time that the RA bumped into me at school and told me) that dry ice was fine and we could do whatever.  SO...  we went to Fleet Farm and wandered around the piping section for awhile, calling measurements of pipe back and forth to eachother, each of his mentally figuring out how to put this together.  We seemed to attract the attention of a store worker, who walked up to me.\n\nHim: \"You boys must have one hell of a plumbing problem.\"\nMe: \"Nope, building a steam engine.\"\n\nSo we got back home, looked at one or two parts we bought and started talking about designs, after we had just got done looking at what we had to work with.  We eventually would go back to the store 3 times, replacing parts, buyi",

That's not a bad thing though, it was good of you to try to abide by the rules, no one likes any surprise fines or violations. That's a level of accountability and respect that you just don't normally see in the dorms haha.\n\nAs for the steam engine, sounds like a pretty ambitious project, I'm looking forward to seeing the results",

She helped me figure out a few calculations that I had been wondering, and apparently the mechanical advantage will work better with this idea I had, so the design has been altered drastically.  The professor was very interested in the project, hell, she even asked if we were going to have it generate electricity (an electromagnetic generator).  That was an idea that jason had, and we may still do it in a later model/revision of the train, but for now we're just powering the wheels.\n\nShe wants us to bring it up for a demonstration after we finish it and have it running fine.  This basically gives us an excuse to do it on campus, and gives us an alliby.\n\nNow I need to buy chains and sprockets.  Joy.  Also, we apparently have to soder the copper piping together.  This entire thing is one giant experient and we're pretty much just making it up as we go.  Good times.",

We thought about getting some movies, eating some candy, but other than that the plan seemed somewhat dull.  I brought up the idea that maybe we could get some dry ice and make some fog, or put it ontop of the fridge so it billows down to the floor.  That's how the conversation derailed a bit, and we started talking about dry ice and pressure and about half an hour later we both decided it was a great idea.\n\nWe were going to build a \"steam\" engine that ran on dry ice.\n\nNow, the first thing we had to do was ask the RA (Residential Advisor) here at the college dorms if dry ice was violating any of the forbidden materials rules.  I went up to her room and asked her about the dry ice probably for halloween and possibly for a side project that Jason and I were thinking about.\n\nShe honestly had no idea, so she called her supervisor friend.\n\nHe had no idea and told her to call the Housing Director.\n\nShe called the Housing Director and she had no idea, and said to call her higher-up.\n\n So apparently I asked something that nobody has thought of before, and they had to bounce around all over the higher ups in the college until some guy came to our apartment and told jason (at the same time that the RA bumped into me at school and told me) that dry ice was fine and we could do whatever.  SO...  we went to Fleet Farm and wandered around the piping section for awhile, calling measurements of pipe back and forth to eachother, each of his mentally figuring out how to put this together.  We seemed to attract the attention of a store worker, who walked up to me.\n\nHim: \"You boys must have one hell of a plumbing problem.\"\nMe: \"Nope, building a steam engine.\"\n\nSo we got back home, looked at one or two parts we bought and started talking about designs, after we had just got done looking at what we had to work with.

She helped me figure out a few calculations that I had been wondering, and apparently the mechanical advantage will work better with this idea I had, so the design has been altered drastically.  The professor was very interested in the project, hell, she even asked if we were going to have it generate electricity (an electromagnetic generator).  That was an idea that jason had, and we may still do it in a later model/revision of the train, but for now we're just powering the wheels.\n\nShe wants us to bring it up for a demonstration after we finish it and have it running fine.  This basically gives us an excuse to do it on campus, and gives us an alliby.\n\nNow I need to buy chains and sprockets.  Joy.  Also, we apparently have to soder the copper piping together.  This entire thing is one giant experient and we're pretty much just making it up as we go.  Good times.",

She helped me figure out a few calculations that I had been wondering, and apparently the mechanical advantage will work better with this idea I had, so the design has been altered drastically.  The professor was very interested in the project, hell, she even asked if we were going to have it generate electricity (an electromagnetic generator).  That was an idea that jason had, and we may still do it in a later model/revision of the train, but for now we're just powering the wheels.\n\nShe wants us to bring it up for a demonstration after we finish it and have it running fine.  This basically gives us an excuse to do it on campus, and gives us an alliby.\n\nNow I need to buy chains and sprockets.  Joy.  Also, we apparently have to soder the copper piping together.  This entire thing is one giant experient and we're pretty much just making it up as we go.  Good times.",

Didn't reach too far but I've always loved text-games and seeing the father of all text-games left me again with the feeling to start doing my own, again, like for the 40th time.\n\nBut this time I lurked, and I lurked well, because I found the answer. Inform 7, a program that is rather... funny and amazing, is easy to use and easy to learn.\nYou don't need to learn new languages and fuck C#/C++/Java/LISP or whatever man because I honestly can't be bothered taking a whole year of learning to get this rolling and taking me another year to get it working. Inform just takes what you write, as if it was a true written story, and turns it into the game.\n\nIt's awesome.\n\nBut why post this on a board that hasn't been used for months? Because I need YOU. I need people to make maybe a cover art for the thing and also to play test the thing. Hopefully I can get something up for you guys tonight but I wouldn't push it, yeah it's that easy but some of the commands are just weird, on the other hand I learn and work fast so 50/50.\n\nI await to hear any comments.

Furious is a large man, with mean features. He wears some kinda armor (flak vest, scrap metal suit, chainmail bikini breifs, whatever), and is never without his infamous \"Voodoo Hat\", which he believes gives him luck. Furious loves knives and sharp pointy things and always has several of these strapped to his person. He also bears a rather exciting snake tattoo and wears a necklace of monkey bones...or are those babies? His signature weapon is a battle axe type of thing, a large heavy blade on a stick, and along with that he carries a hefty sidearm.\n\n     Furious Snake is always accompanied by his righthand man...er...girl...Black Eyed Susan, a lanky broad with a robotic arm and a collection of shrunken heads. She chain smokes hand rolled cigarettes and covers her ass with a conglomeration of leather, pelts, and shiny bits of metal. Her weapons of choice are a long handled spear cobbled together from everyday household items and a matched set of bone handled nickel plated six shooters, she wears slung low.\n\n     Furious Snake, being such a charismatic chap, is also attended by a loyal sidekick, Feekal, a freeky mutant wih extra bits. Feekal is swaddled in grimey rags and sports a gigantic gun (bazooka, speargun,radial flux beamer, whatever). Feekal carries a stereo boom box, for times when he feels the need to bust a move, and because he is the sidekick he also carries all of Furious Snake's extraneous gear (liquor, smokes, ammo, waffles, jimmy hats, whatever) in, strapped to or sticking out of a (satchel, back pack, ruck sack, hollowed out pigs head, whatever). \n\n-----------------------------",

Now that he has executed on his plan, he is able to reveal his inner power.\n\nOr maybe he is still a wiener.\n\nAll of the music in Halo was composed by Martin O'Donnel. It was on the Halo 2 soundtrack that they got actual bands to do tributes or covers or \"inspired by\" or whatever you want to call them. There was a piece of the Making Of on the Limited/Legendary Halo 3 Edition discs that focused squarely on the music and sound. One of the more interesting parts of the entire process or documentary in my opinion.\n\nYou can read more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_%28series%29#Music",

The key here is going against the grain and unlikely situations is not only part of the humor, it's a distinct writing style because it separates you from the pack. All elves are not magical. All dwarves do not have to hate elves. Just because Tolken wrote it once doesn't make it the status quo.\n\nThis is something they tried to push with 3rd Edition Dungeons and Dragons, the idea that even a brutish Orc could make a good Rogue, despite having no stealthy qualities what so ever because he smells funny, he lumbers around too heavily to sneak anywhere, and no shadow is large enough for him to hide inside of. Yet with some careful thought and creativity an Orc could be a perfect rogue. He doesn't pick pockets, he outright takes pockets. He doesn't work with a silver tongue and charm, he works with fear and intimidation.\n\nOr maybe he does have all of these qualities. Maybe he was abandoned at youth for being scrawny and weak, qualities despised by his strong blood orc family. Maybe he used ash or makeup to attempt to hide his appearance or identity. Maybe he turned to a life of theifdom to survive, and is in fact quite a good text book rogue because of his background and upbringing.\n\nSo just because Ian is a wiener, that doesn't have to drag down the story. Besides, Ian is only a wiener because you actually know him. I've only played Halo with him. I cannot verify his wienerdom.",

I think the situation's pretty neat, but that will have to be decided by each reader.\n\nAnyways, I guess I should ask a question or something to promote posting, so what do you think?  Should I release it in individual perspectives, or just wait until I have the whole thing done?",

I'm trying to write this with out any spoilers for the others who might come along and download your story.\n\nAside from some of the grammar issues, which if I recall English is your second language*, the only critical thing I have to say is at the end the jump from when the corporal is yelling at Scivio to the next paragraph is jarring. After reading it twice, I got what you were getting across but it was very confusing. Especially since I take it the 'box' had something to do with what Scivio did, but you didn't mention the box earlier in the story. Or I could be wrong about that...\n\nStill I liked the story, I liked the hinted at background you gave us on this new world of yours and especially liked the suspense you were building up with Scivio in his head. \n\n*I am impressed that anyone can master a second  language enough to write a story in it, so don't let grammar bother you. After all that's what editors are for. Hell, english is my first language and I screw it up all the time, not to mention if I tried to write a story in spanish, it would be two sentences about a man asking about your house and if he can have some more beer. lol.",

      "content": "The Secret Mort story, here in the NRC has been going on for three years. Sometimes it has really rolled with lots of people writting lots of bits fast and hard. Mostly it's been slow. I created Secret Mort back in the early ninties and he has been all over doing all kinda of nefarious shit. Stories and drawings, tales retold around the camp fire and over beers on the porch. To me, Mort is a post apocalyptic Icon. Which brings me to my point. The Secret Mort stories have always been a group activity. I've thought of just going it alone and writing more of his adventures by myself. But that removes the basic principles Mort was built on. I don't wanna do that. There's a little bit of Mort in all of us and I'd like to bring it out and put it all together. So here's what I'm gonna do. The 30 days of Secret Mort is a project type contest. Everyone who contributes at least three decent story enhancing posts to the Winter Wonder Wasteland story here in the NRC, in the 30 days from April 5th 2005 to May 5th 2005, will recieve (no really) a prize. The prize will be a printed and fancily bound copy of the story with as many illustrations of the text as I can work up in a reasonable amount of time. I've already started on the art for the book, all you people of Nurk! need to do is keep it rolling and bring it full circle. I'll be writing to. Any one who feels inspired can also submit illustrations for the story and I'll include them to. Our story... our art... here at Nurk and a printed bond copy in yer mail box! The 5th of May is my birthday. I'll be 30. I think this is an awesome project, for us all. So join in. Gird up yer wriiting loins and hit the wastes. This story can go anywhere, it's been blowing up Schmooville for three years and poor Mort still hasn't gotten his beer. So that's the deal. Three good posts in the thread, perhaps an illustration of the action, and you get a nice bound copy of the illustrated, Secret Mort in the Winter Wonder Wasteland, in yer mailbox.",

But they are only like 2 pages long. They are just goofy. The Story from the forums Winter Wonder Wasteland is really long but it's pretty fun to read, I think.

The only problem is he'd be pretty damn near the same as sonic, just with a glide ability...Not sure why every \"game of origin\" needs two characters or more from each though...isn't one enough?",

I managed to unlock the tight rope game and I was doing pretty amazing with that too.  Hurray!  \n\nI'm also ranked \"bodybuilder\" in lunges (for strength training.)  Yes!  I am the Lunge Master!  \n\nHowever my BMI is 26.5 or something and I guess I need to lose some pounds or at least convert the fat to muscle to be healthy.  The Wii says that people averaging a BMI of 22 are least likely to have health problems?  Crazy.  I'm 171 pounds and 6'3.  It considers me having a normal weight.    My Fitness Age was like 32 or something.  Yeah, I guess I need to get in shape.\n\nMy mom was ranked \"overweight\" but her age and her Fitness Age matched perfectly!  So I guess even though she's overweight she's where she is supposed to be.  Her BMI was pretty high though.  \n\nI totally feel the burn guys.  This game is wack.  It's fun though.  My balance sucks, but hey if it teaches me posture that's cool.  It's kind of scary having that mannequin-like trainer though, but ah well.  He's helpful and cheers me on when I suck.\n\nThe Hula Hoop thing is ridiculous.  My mom totally pwned me on that.  I'm like, \"How do I spin my hips!  MY HIPS WEREN'T MADE FOR SPINNING!\"\n\nApparently my mom is a hula hoop fiend though.  They should have ranks like that, seriously.\n\nSo buy Wii Fit.   You'll lose weight and you'll feel like you've actually accomplished something.  \n\nI think.",

The main playable character is Secret Mort. A young thug who likes drinkin\u2019, shootin\u2019, and racin\u2019 around in modified slag wagons. He lives in a slapped together crap shack out in the wastes, where he generally hangs out on a crusty couch on  the front porch, with his crusty friends, Filthy Martin, Squishy Dave, and Scabby Chris, drinking beer, smoking weed, and shooting at mutants that wander into his yard. Then they all drive down to the local Chicken Bunker for some radioactive hotwings. This is the sweet life of Secret Mort. But like any young feller, adventure is always around the corner, for this wasteland is no ordinary radioactive desert. The blasted rock and shifting ash give way to mysterious swamps, mutant jungles, glowing ruins, barbarous shanty towns and anti-gravity mud forts inhabited by mad scientists and their armies of genetically altered cheerleaders. Secret Mort can\u2019t even go into town on  a beer run without being chased by aliens, hustled by crackwhores, and shot at by renegade mafiosos, not to mention the pantsless ass monger cannibal, El Magnifico. \n\nAlso find out more about Mort here: Secret Mort Link #1, Secret Mort Link #2, Secret Mort Link #3 and also the most important to this site HERE.",

He's so fu***** stupid, and i wanna tear his head off.\n\nHe also claims that Wii is a \"Fad\" and it'll wear off by next month. WRONG. according to a dude at best buy, the Wii's have been flying off the shelves the entire year it's been released, and it really flying off shelves so near Christmas time this year.\n\nI also know some Microsoft call of duty fan boy, who destroyed a Wii he somehow acquired by throwing it off of his roof. A dumbass if you ask me. A Wii is better than anything out there, and to judge it by its looks is stupid. Fuck anyone who uses the excuse \"Kiddy\" for any Wii game. GRAHHRHAHRHHARHARHAR\n\nSorry, he's just been pissing me off. DAMN YOU MICROSOFT FAN BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n(Pardon the French in this rant, I apologize for it)",

Really I am.\n\n3) The Wii sucks.\n\n4) The Xbox, Xbox 360 and Microsoft all suck too.\n\n5) Consoles, in general suck. \n\nFor mindless shooting/action type games they are nice but for anything else they blow. They controls suck. Akward feeling, unintuitive and not enough buttons in logical places. Not to mention horrid menu systems that are annoying and user unfriendly. The PC is the place for anything rpg or close to rpg but these game developers keep trying to push everything over to console. \n\nI tried playing dead rising on the Xbox and I really wanted to love that game 'cause I'm such a zombie freak. It was five days of pain for me, constantly dying due to the shitty play style of trying to use a controller that's frankly unintuitive and menu driven crap. All the other games I've tried have been the same. The only thing remotely fun, is the shooters and those are still annoying.\n\nWhat I've played of the Wii, which hasn't been alot, hasn't been much different.",

They go through the stages of new, popular, phenom, fad, and finally niche. There's guys still playing Atari. They'll be guys still playing the Wii.\n\nBut anyone calling the Wii a fad is scared. You know, I don't know why the kids thing is a knock against Nintendo.\n\n1) We, my generation at least, grew up playing games. We were kids, the games were for kids. We were teens, the games were for teens. Now we're adults and you got shit like GTA, and Manhunt. Bloody violently terrible things. We grew up. The platform grew up. There were always odd games that broke that mold, but I find it's held true. I sometimes look back, or I look on the shelf, and I try to decide what I would play if I were a kid. There ain't much. So god bless Nintendo if they make kids games, that is a void that needs filled, for the kids sake.\n\n2) So fucking what. Mario is so awesome, he fucked that dude's mother, and Peach filmed it because she's a freaky fuck princess like that. Mario Galaxy is awesome. Just because it's a kids game doesn't mean it ain't fun. Fuck, I played all the way through Cookies and Cream.. a game that requires two players because it's split vertically and you have to help each other solve puzzles so you can make it to the end gate together. It was gushy and colorful and lovey and sharey and carey.. that was a fucking kids game. I enjoyed it. I made Timmy enjoy it, so I could finish it. I don't let predudice and ignorance get in the way of a fun game concept, or a new game.\n\nKeep fighting the good fight, Kevin.",

I never set foot in a theater on a weekend or anywhere near opening night. I might really want to see the movie bad... but I know I'll get hosed... so I wait. No one ever goes to a matinee on a tuesday. You basically get the whole theater to yourself. If you dont have the luxury of being able to goto movies during a weekday try a sunday morning matinee. It wont be as vacant but I find most of the loud obnoxious inconsiderate fuck holes and their sticky fingered hell spawn children who seem to enjoy ruining your movie experience are at church during that time.\n\nSorry your movie got crapped on. I really want to see it. Did you get to see any of it? What did you think? I really like Eli Roth's directing. Although I hate the fact Quentin Tarantino doesnt make movies anymore he just goes around sticking his name to other peoples shit. Rereleasing old movies under his label and such. What a wanker. I've always really liked his work. But this one time I rented some anime and there was an intro by Quentin, basically stating how he was responsible for anime being in the US and how he knows so much more about it than anyone else... blah blah blah... I fucking hate that. I was watching Miyazaki movies in 1980... fuck you Quentin Tarantino!",

You could talk all you fucking wanted to, it was in your car. It didn't matter.

Then in between that they'd start talking.  During intermission the girl who was wearing one of those easy to snag kind of elasti pants that ride at your hips or just below started pulling them up.  PULLING THEM UP!  When they go below your hips from starters, I don't think you have to worry about a wedgie, you know? \n\nAh well.  I don't know what they were doing, I don't want to guess.  Point is, it's disgusting and they pay 50 some dollars just to do it when they could do it in their own home. \n\nOn the other side of me was Megan.  She didn't do anything annoying (she just snickered everytime I made faces of angst), but the guy beside her who correct me in pronouncing Dumar as in Alexander Dumar (course I just might be spelling it wrong, aaaargh) ended up getting sloshed after intermission.  When he came back he kept whistling and sighing a whole lot.  So there you have it.  Even the english professor types aren't behaved enough to watch a musical.\n\nAnd then my problem...\n\nWhen you watch the movie version of Phantom of the Opera, I think it kind of spoils you.  When you're doing a movie you can make it perfect because even if people make a mistake you can always do it again.  But when you see it performed...you only get to see it once, one shot, to see if they get it right.\n\nI think that that is supposed to be what makes the stage so great.  It's a lot harder to do everything perfect in one take and that's what these people do.\n\nBut the glint and glamour of the movie still ruined the stage performance for me.  I don't know why.  I guess before seeing the movie you should be able to appreciate how great it is done live first.  And then watch the movie.  Maybe then it enhances you're love for the show.\n\nI liked it.  But I didn't love it.  I didn't stare at it in wide-eyed wonder.  When I saw L",

At least they dont shoot back.\n\nMy first day with my first character went like this...\n\nStarted out as a 1st lvl cop. Walked around. Saw a Zombie. Took a shot at it. I missed. Moved on. Looted a junk yard and found a length of pipe and a fireaxe. Sweet. I moved and looted a few more buildings but found nothing of interest. I saw like two more zombies. I went into a strongly fortified police station and meet like 15 other people. Safe inside I went to sleep. End of day.\n\nI started a second character. A soldier. Walked a bit saw a zombie. Got cocky and blasted at him till I was out of ammo. He wasn't dead yet and two more zombies had shown up. One took a bite outta me. Luckily it wasnt the infectious kinda. I ran. Ran right into 7 zombies in a clump. Ran some more. Found 10 zombies. Crap! I was running out of action points and had no place to hide. I ran into a random building and just closed all the doors. Now Im in a regular old building with only closed doors and windows between me and the zombies. I'm a bit worried. Any basically text based game that makes me worry and stay alittle scared even when I not playing it is awesome. Although I do have a bit of an overactive imagination. But still. I love this game.\n\nOn that note. I'm off to help set up for the zombie internatrional ping pong tournament and party!\n\nPeace!",

Furious is a large man, with mean features. He wears some kinda armor (flak vest, scrap metal suit, chainmail bikini breifs, whatever), and is never without his infamous \"Voodoo Hat\", which he believes gives him luck. Furious loves knives and sharp pointy things and always has several of these strapped to his person. He also bears a rather exciting snake tattoo and wears a necklace of monkey bones...or are those babies? His signature weapon is a battle axe type of thing, a large heavy blade on a stick, and along with that he carries a hefty sidearm.\n\n     Furious Snake is always accompanied by his righthand man...er...girl...Black Eyed Susan, a lanky broad with a robotic arm and a collection of shrunken heads. She chain smokes hand rolled cigarettes and covers her ass with a conglomeration of leather, pelts, and shiny bits of metal. Her weapons of choice are a long handled spear cobbled together from everyday household items and a matched set of bone handled nickel plated six shooters, she wears slung low.\n\n     Furious Snake, being such a charismatic chap, is also attended by a loyal sidekick, Feekal, a freeky mutant wih extra bits. Feekal is swaddled in grimey rags and sports a gigantic gun (bazooka, speargun,radial flux beamer, whatever). Feekal carries a stereo boom box, for times when he feels the need to bust a move, and because he is the sidekick he also carries all of Furious Snake's extraneous gear (liquor, smokes, ammo, waffles, jimmy hats, whatever) in, strapped to or sticking out of a (satchel, back pack, ruck sack, hollowed out pigs head, whatever). \n\n-----------------------------",

This has a more Jazzy feel to it so enjoy.\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter an hour of playing around I finished this. It clocks around 4:30 which is the longest I've produced so far.

It sounds so fucking dirty the distortion is horrible, at least it sounds better than the integrated distortion, what I fucking need is a 100 Watt Head Iba\u00f1ez or Spider II, maybe even a fucking Crate or Marshall. That's why I'm opening my \"Buy Vico Surge the Correct Instrument\" Fund so I can get some decent shit! And it's not that I'm cheap but I hate having to pay 500 bucks for an Amp I can find at 250 on San Diego but my fucking currency is so shitty it ain't worth a fuck when trying to get some decent equipment.\n\nCorrection. I now have in my possesion a 45 Watts Squire Amp and I can say now I'm fully satisfied with it. Yamaha ain't worth shit and here's why. The not so tiny 25 Watt Yamaha Amp needed to be at volume level 5 ot 6 for the Distortion to have a good tone even when the distortion itself is at level 8! And the horrible thing is that the fucking thing was about to crack, I could hear pops and crackles every once in a while, so I was getting real pissed. Now with the Squire it's a whole different story. This baby is barelly at Level 1 with the Distortion in 9 and I'm getting blown the fuck away with the power of the speaker. This baby rocks! I don't hear any pops or crackles anymore and the only problem it has is the main port for the guitar which seems to be damaged, I noticed when I had to move the cable all around until I could hear a clean noise, but who cares for 70 bucks!\n\nCheck out the link, sorry for the size of the pic but my camera blows, to check out what I'm working with! For those who can't make it out, and probably most won't make it out, there's a copy of a Strat Guitar, Sunrise Model, the Squire 45 Watts and a Danelectro Black Coffee Distortion (Wake up and smell the coffee... they weren't joking about that one). Plus all the cables and on the background an old non-working PC which I plan to fix to use as a third recording platform.\n\n-Vico Surge",

Someone and I were discussing the lack of updates, or not putting stuff on the site we already know (like Solid Snake being a fighter even though he doesn't have a page yet).\n\nBut I explained it like this. When I was running the site for WL2042, we setup a schedule for weapons updates. Every Thursday, new weapon revealed, new shot of it, new blurb. Not much, but we kept a beat to it, set our watch to it. Soon I didn't even had to put out the announcement, every Thursday 10,000 people showed up on the site wanting to know where the weapon was at.\n\nThat is the kind of regularity they're setting up here, and it's effective. They've probably got all the updates pre-metered out to take them right up to the release day.\n\nBut yeah, playing this one is going to be awesome, especially if they stick to the online play. If they drop it I will never forgive them.\n\nAnd still buy it because I'm a sucker.",

For some of you that may or may not know, the character Ness was added into Smash Bros. Melee.  Ness, the striped shirt and cap wearing, baseball bat toting teenager is the main character of the game Earthbound.  Throughout Earthbound, Ness developes a special psychic attack that only he can cast, it damages all enemies and deals insane ammounts of damage.\n\nDevs from Melee were quoted to say that they removed this trademark move of Ness because it was too powerful to be used in-game.\n\nIf these smash balls allow for an ultra powerful finale attack...Ness just might be able to use...\n\nPSI ROCKIN!",

I'm not sure what this means really as I just developed it and the adjectives \"first\" and \"annual\" make it sound a whole lot better than what it is; however, first and foremost this is all in good fun.\n\nSome of you may come in here wanting to get your greedy little paws on the prizes. Well in case you are wondering what the prizes are before you get your greedy little paws on them I'll tell you.\n\nPrizes:\n\nGrand Prize: The Omega Man - One of the more popular post apocalyptic movies which stars Charlton Heston. \n\n1st Runner up: One pack of anti-radiation (iodide pills) to keep you from getting thyroid cancer in case of nuclear attack.\n\n2nd Runner up: The first Deathlands novel: Pilgrimage to Hell by Jack Adrian\n\nNow for the guidelines:\n\nA lot of the post apocalyptic stories I've read recently have always had a dark, depressing ending to them. Characters are always brooding and it's understandable why they feel this way. They're knee deep in hell so to speak. \n\nWhile I don't want writers to make a happy go lucky wasteland adventure I'm going to offer up a very small challenge to kick up this contest (and the challenges will get harder with each contest). I want you all to have a happy ending. \n\nPerhaps we have a character who has always wanted to pledge his undying love for another, but for reasons out of his control (man vs nature, man vs man, man vs himself, man vs machine) he finds himself failing to do so. Maybe he's given one last chance to prove his love or to simply show it and that's what the story revolves around.\n\nOr maybe we have a tale about a paradisaic utopia inside a government vault where people have made peace with themselves. They've become mild mannered, loving, and are very kind. But there is something that poses a threat to them and to their order and they must develop a way to either cover up this horrible secret, stop it, or allow it to consume them altogether. Bu",

      "content": "Alrighty I'll tackle both questions at once. I thought about answering them, but then I started to think about how much I hated high school essays and how restrictive they were.\n\nFirst and foremost I have always hating having to have 800 word essay or a two page paper on blah blah blah. I mean when I'm writing something how am I supposed to know how long it is? And when I do write something I consider everything that is there worth being there and I hate getting rid of stuff just because someone doesn't want to read it.\n\nMy answer for length is that I want a short story. I don't want any novels and I certainly don't want a two paragraph story unless of course you can really get your point across with those two paragraphs. And just because you may submit something that's 15 pages doesn't necessarily mean that you'll win because it's long. Quality over quantity as they always say.\n\nAs for the universe well again I don't want to restrict anyone.  If they want to write something about Fallout, I probably wouldn't be to happy about it, but you know what? If it's a good Fallout fiction then fine. I would really like to have some original fiction though as I had highlighted in the example scenarios.  \n\nSo lets see...don't make my eyeballs explode with a novel or novella length story and try to be original. I suppose that's the answer all summed up in a setence. Don't you want to kill me for making you read everything above?",

If you aren't familiar with Gamma World, it was a post apocalyptic pnp role playing game.\n\nWizards of the Coast made a remake of Gamma World using their Alternity game, but, as the cover says, it's stand alone. Since I don't have a credit card, I don't use Ebay which is making things even more difficult to find.\n\nI suppose I could just get the original which would be cooler, but I was thinking about it for a future prize.  If we get lots of good work then we'll have better prizes.\n\nBut really...I'm starting to wonder if there should be some sort of donation system or something developed for prizes. I mean being a college student I'm certainly not made of money, and regardless if you're in college, high school, or are in the working field, who is?  I would hope that most of us, as post apocalyptic fans would put a big thumbs down to materialism, but you never know.\n\nStill...I don't see any monthly contests in the future for Nurk. I suppose season contacts could be realistic, but the real problem, in my opinion, would be shipping things off the continent to Europe and the like.\n\nI remember Ashmodai of the Fallout Network having some company send me Warcraft 3 Collector's Edition. Once it came to me I mailed it to Germany, where he lives. And he paid me back and all that, but he also had to pay some sort of fee just for getting the package! I think overall he paid some 200 dollars for the stupid game. I asked him if it was worth it. It never is.\n\nSo really...it's just something to think about.  Entrust Bitterman with donation money, I say, and then we show him what we want and he buys it.  It is HIS site afterall and if we can't trust him then, heck, why are we here? Hehe.  And with donations and all that it'd be easier to get better prizes.\n\nWho knows perhaps someday we'll even be able to give away an Israeli gas mask or an infant radiation suit (which I've located by the way)! And the infant radiatio",

If I can get around to doing my own entry I'll make sure to scan the roughs when the grid and vanishing point lines are all prominant and visible for you.\n\nIt's definatly a very usefull skill to have in the illustration world, so if it's something you tackle in 9th grade (freshman year of highschool ey?) then more power to ya.",

Main points are the fretboard, which goes all the way to the bridge, which not only wouldn't be accessable for playing, but also blocks any space for pickups and the tuning pegs working the way they do, which would cause for a mega heavy head (for gnarly neck dive) and also likely heavy tuning instability with a lot of string breaks from the heavy pressure at the nut....looks cool as hell though, I'd just like to see the idea applied to a second more realistic body/neck design!",
