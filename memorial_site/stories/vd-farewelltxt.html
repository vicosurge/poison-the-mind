            <p>Vault Dwellers Farewell</p>
<p>-Scotty the Great</p>
<p>As I wandered through that baron abyss,</p>
<p>An outcast from my own home I will miss,</p>
<p>I thought of the past, present, future,</p>
<p>I glimpsed the way of human nature,</p>
<p>And realized that this fate,</p>
<p>This wondrous, mysterious mate,</p>
<p>I did realize then it was for real,</p>
<p>It couldn't be avoided by any deal,</p>
<p>No one could avoid it or stop it,</p>
<p>We were humans and it would be lit,</p>
<p>That seemingly glorious force</p>
<p>That bomb, it would coerce,</p>
<p>Us all, not being able to resist,</p>
<p>We would fight, and it would persist,</p>
<p>Until we couldn't handle it anymore,</p>
<p>So that the boiling earth met the shore,</p>
<p>Of the oceans, only then the fire ended,</p>
<p>And then how would nature be mended?</p>
<p>We didn't worry about anything,</p>
<p>Except that persistent thing,</p>
<p>That hatred we could only posses,</p>
<p>That we could only unleash and mess,</p>
<p>Up the world beyond mending,</p>
<p>It couldn't be fixed by simple bending,</p>
<p>And now what about me?</p>
<p>I stopped, bent down on my knee,</p>
<p>And wondered why I took that horrid task,</p>
<p>To save the vault, maybe for glory to bask?</p>
<p>I did not foresee what would result,</p>
<p>How could I, I never gave it a though,</p>
<p>It did make sense to kick me out, though,</p>
<p>With the Overseer, his intelligence would show,</p>
<p>As he made it final, and left me there,</p>
<p>And now inside, I would feel so bare,</p>
<p>I lost everything, I lost all I had,</p>
<p>How could the treat me that bad?</p>
<p>I did not know where to go, to whom to turn,</p>
<p>So many enemies now that want me to crash and burn,</p>
<p>No one would help me now,</p>
<p>Not even an intelligent cow,</p>
<p>Then again, there was that glimmer of sun,</p>
<p>Off of the long shaft of my Minigun,</p>
<p>And I knew that I would be ok.</p>
