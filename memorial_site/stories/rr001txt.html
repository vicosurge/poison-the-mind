            <p>Random Rendering #001</p>
<p>Written by:  Scotty the Great</p>
<p>As I wandered through that desolate cave so dreary,</p>
<p>Only a scarce sound could be heard, it was so eerie,</p>
<p>The sound was of water dripping, leaking, falling,</p>
<p>From an unknown source in which I was not weary.</p>
<p>Each drop fell into a puddle, evidently splashing,</p>
<p>Where did it fall to, where was it finally landing?</p>
<p>Wondering about this more I would not prolong,</p>
<p>For it was pulling on my sanity, that cold song,</p>
<p>Instead I looked about my residing location,</p>
<p>Allowing my strings of sanity remaining to prolong.</p>
<p>I noticed the slick walls that occupied my station,</p>
<p>Each damp with a glowing, glistening sensation.</p>
<p>The stench of the bellowing, black, desolate cavern,</p>
<p>Was one not even matched by the most foul tavern.</p>
<p>Indeed it was a smell that would enflame the nose.</p>
<p>The presence of the putrid, foul odor was all so stern,</p>
<p>The origin must be that of the long dead, I suppose,</p>
<p>As my face presumed a twisted, disgusted pose.</p>
<p>Onward I pressed, through almost total darkness,</p>
<p>Only spared by the flare that lit the black abyss.</p>
<p>The cave beckoned to me, calling, yearning,</p>
<p>Soothing my mind with an ever so gentle caress,</p>
<p>I could not resist, I had to follow the calling,</p>
<p>I had to go on, the cave was too persisting.</p>
<p>I followed the cave, followed it continually.</p>
<p>I had no choice, I was now attached emotionally,</p>
<p>To this place, this place that was forbidden,</p>
<p>To this place, which was kept secret purposely.</p>
<p>Gracefully, though, the directions I was given,</p>
<p>By someone who didn't care if I was livin'.</p>
<p>He was obviously crazy, out of his sane mind,</p>
<p>Placed out of society, his fate had been signed.</p>
<p>He resided in the Hub, outside a lonely house,</p>
<p>The house contained one who was all so kind,</p>
<p>But also was outcast, lonely, with no spouse,</p>
<p>And not even the dreary presence of a mouse.</p>
<p>His soul had decayed, as well as the rest of him,</p>
<p>As his skin discolored and pealed from the limb,</p>
<p>Few knew him, but all looked down on Harold,</p>
<p>The mutant whose malnourishment left him slim.</p>
<p>His story would cause your spine to run cold,</p>
<p>It told why his body now sprouted green mold.</p>
<p>Tragedy had been his calling, and he answered,</p>
<p>But inadvertently, at least, he firmly claimed.</p>
<p>It was an accident, incident, and in end tragedy,</p>
<p>One that left his body now and forever maimed.</p>
<p>His allies left or disappeared on that very day,</p>
<p>And he was found in the desert, he would say.</p>
<p>His story, was not in my thoughts at present,</p>
<p>But instead someone else and what he meant,</p>
<p>Resided in my mind. Curiosity rampaged it,</p>
<p>As to the cave the man would have me sent.</p>
<p>From his ramblings about a first-aid kit,</p>
<p>I had the feeling my skin would be slit.</p>
<p>I wandered further, trying to hide all sound,</p>
<p>When I heard a howl, as of a great hound</p>
<p>That had been stricken down and now hurt,</p>
<p>Perhaps because it was receiving a pound.</p>
<p>The sound, so close, put my senses on alert,</p>
<p>Because for death I felt I had no current cert.</p>
<p>In the distance I saw a light shining, emitting,</p>
<p>The source unknown, it was unremitting, unstopping.</p>
<p>Puzzled, I continued onward slowly, cautiously.</p>
<p>I was able to make out a figure laying, resting,</p>
<p>On the ground, as if it received something deadly.</p>
<p>I thought it was dead, until it cried out painfully.</p>
<p>I knew it wasn't human, but something different,</p>
<p>Something monstrous, and doubtlessly indeferent.</p>
<p>I wondered what could have happened to the beast,</p>
<p>How it could have been injured to such a great extent.</p>
<p>It moaned one last time, and then all sound ceased.</p>
<p>I watched the creature, but it did not move in the least.</p>
<p>Suddenly, movement from the side caught my sight,</p>
<p>But it was shielded by darkness, just out of the light.</p>
<p>Stillness then resumed. I waited for more movement,</p>
<p>But silence persisted, causing me to think it might</p>
<p>Have been my imagination; it does not seek development.</p>
<p>Waiting, peering into darkness, I soon grew impatient.</p>
<p>Drawing my weapon, ever so slowly, ever so silently,</p>
<p>As I prepared to advance, hoping it would not be regretfully</p>
<p>To venture onward. Suddenly, something caught my eye,</p>
<p>To my right, the beast rushed on me ever so relentlessly,</p>
<p>The horrid beast had shocked me; it was definitely sly.</p>
<p>Now I turned to fight it, almost certain that I would die.</p>
<p>The beast was tall, fierce, muscular, and also intimidating,</p>
<p>His eyes contained a fire that hid what he was contemplating.</p>
<p>Rows of jagged teeth, blood dripping down from each one,</p>
<p>Probably from his last victim, the thought was nauseating.</p>
<p>Huge claws, pointy and shiny, could be stopped by none.</p>
<p>The beast growled loudly, a growl that would scare anyone.</p>
<p>I knew that this beast was what I had come in search for,</p>
<p>It was a Death Claw; I had imagined less, but it was much more,</p>
<p>Than I had expected, and I now began to greatly worry.</p>
<p>I was not prepared for a beast with strength of such great galore.</p>
<p>My equipment would not hold, and I began to feel sorry</p>
<p>For coming here; I was not ready for a fight this gory.</p>
<p>The Death Claw raised his heavy claw, getting ready to attack.</p>
<p>I raised my gun and fired, but the beast did not draw back.</p>
<p>It did not flinch, did not move, instead it growled with anger.</p>
<p>The bullet penetrated, and the beast bled blood that was black.</p>
<p>My eyes opened wide in terror, and I suddenly was very eager</p>
<p>To leave this place, but knew my chances were too meager.</p>
<p>The Death Claw sliced down with his claw, and instantly I felt pain.</p>
<p>I felt the coldness of each claw penetrate my torso; I knew I was slain.</p>
<p>The claws dug downward, ripping apart my organs and my bones.</p>
<p>The beast then removed his claws; the feeling was driving me insane.</p>
<p>I gasped for breath, but all that escaped my mouth were meager moans.</p>
<p>The claw destroyed my lungs, so all I could utter were suppressed groans.</p>
<p>I moved my hands slowly to my chest, fearing what I would find.</p>
<p>I looked down at my torso, causing more pain to enter my mind</p>
<p>As I saw the horrific site, I was amazed that I was still living.</p>
<p>It amazed me how a human could survive a wound of that kind.</p>
<p>Blood gushed outward, and with it my organs too started falling,</p>
<p>I cringed in pain as my intestines fell to the ground, splashing.</p>
<p>I pulled my eyes shut; the site was too much for me to take.</p>
<p>I wished now never to have come to this cave, for my sake.</p>
<p>I heard the sound of more organs splashing on the ground.</p>
<p>I looked up at the Death Claw, wondering what it would take</p>
<p>To defeat such a being. Whatever it was, it wasn't found</p>
<p>Inside me. I tried to yell, but could not make any sound.</p>
<p>I knew that it was over, and I was going to now perish.</p>
<p>It would be a moment that the Death Claw would cherish.</p>
<p>It had defeated another one who had searched for him,</p>
<p>One who had wanted to slay it, but would not accomplish</p>
<p>Such a task; chances for success were truly very slim.</p>
<p>And now, the results for me were nothing less than grim.</p>
<p>I fell to the ground, and as I did, came to a realization</p>
<p>That distinctly shed new light on this entire situation.</p>
<p>Many had come to this place to conquer the creature,</p>
<p>But in reality were demonstrating human temptation</p>
<p>To be superior by any means. It was the prime feature</p>
<p>Of the way of humans, their present, past, and future.</p>
<p>The only species on the earth that strived for dominance,</p>
<p>Humans drove Death Claws to such massive violence.</p>
<p>Eager to defeat the beast, wanting superiority over it,</p>
<p>The entire race drove the Claws to such vehemence.</p>
<p>It wanted to live, to survive, and was forced to simply hit</p>
<p>Back on us to survive; we drove the beast to this vivacity</p>
