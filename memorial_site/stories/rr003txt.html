            <p>Random Rendering #003</p>
<p>Written by:  Scotty the Great</p>
<p>He looked up and set his gaze to the bright sun,</p>
<p>And wondered about what he had done.</p>
<p>To give no regard to his horrid past</p>
<p>Almost made him feel at peace at last.</p>
<p>But one can never fully be free</p>
<p>Of the burden of such treachery.</p>
<p>As the past will always return to haunt,</p>
<p>And those memories will always taunt,</p>
<p>And now he finds himself hopelessly confused,</p>
<p>With the horror of how he had been abused.</p>
<p>Cast out of the home he fought to save,</p>
<p>After such the risk of an early grave;</p>
<p>It seemed unreal, and certainly improbable.</p>
<p>But he should have seen what was so palpable!</p>
<p>The Overseer may have spoken the truth,</p>
<p>And he had robbed the vault of its youth.</p>
<p>They followed him and created a village</p>
<p>In isolation, seemingly safe from any pillage.</p>
<p>Of course that does not forgive what was done.</p>
<p>The overseer sent him away as if he was no one!</p>
<p>And at first his following made him quite overjoyed,</p>
<p>As he knew his old friend must have been annoyed.</p>
<p>But now, he looked around and saw his tribe</p>
<p>And shuddered briefly from this new bad vibe</p>
<p>For his years had quickly passed him by</p>
<p>And this depressing thought made him sigh.</p>
<p>He eagerly wished back his youth when he was stronger,</p>
<p>But that was gone, and he would not live much longer.</p>
<p>What is to become when he dies</p>
<p>Of the village Vault 13 does despise?</p>
<p>He wished he had not been followed,</p>
<p>For this is the sorrow in which he now wallowed.</p>
<p>If he had been alone, there would not be</p>
<p>The worry of the approaching travesty.</p>
<p>He thought without me, their grand hero,</p>
<p>My people are as doomed as those at ground zero.</p>
<p>If I lived my days alone and simply died</p>
<p>There would be no one that wouldve cried.</p>
<p>I do not want to leave them right now.</p>
<p>And then he wiped the sweat from his brow.</p>
<p>He looked back to his village and grinned</p>
<p>And realized, despite how his past was sinned,</p>
<p>That after him there would always be his son</p>
<p>Who would protect the village as the Chosen One.</p>
<p>That thought struck him with intrigue,</p>
<p>And now his eyes blinked from fatigue.</p>
<p>He was old and realized he needed sleep</p>
<p>And now he knew the village would weep.</p>
<p>But regardless of his tortured past</p>
<p>He felt sure the pain would not last.</p>
