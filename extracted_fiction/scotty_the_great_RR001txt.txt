Random Rendering #001

Written by:  Scotty the Great

As I wandered through that desolate cave so dreary,

Only a scarce sound could be heard, it was so eerie,

The sound was of water dripping, leaking, falling,

From an unknown source in which I was not weary.

Each drop fell into a puddle, evidently splashing,

Where did it fall to, where was it finally landing?

Wondering about this more I would not prolong,

For it was pulling on my sanity, that cold song,

Instead I looked about my residing location,

Allowing my strings of sanity remaining to prolong.

I noticed the slick walls that occupied my station,

Each damp with a glowing, glistening sensation.

The stench of the bellowing, black, desolate cavern,

Was one not even matched by the most foul tavern.

Indeed it was a smell that would enflame the nose.

The presence of the putrid, foul odor was all so stern,

The origin must be that of the long dead, I suppose,

As my face presumed a twisted, disgusted pose.

Onward I pressed, through almost total darkness,

Only spared by the flare that lit the black abyss.

The cave beckoned to me, calling, yearning,

Soothing my mind with an ever so gentle caress,

I could not resist, I had to follow the calling,

I had to go on, the cave was too persisting.

I followed the cave, followed it continually.

I had no choice, I was now attached emotionally,

To this place, this place that was forbidden,

To this place, which was kept secret purposely.

Gracefully, though, the directions I was given,

By someone who didn't care if I was livin'.

He was obviously crazy, out of his sane mind,

Placed out of society, his fate had been signed.

He resided in the Hub, outside a lonely house,

The house contained one who was all so kind,

But also was outcast, lonely, with no spouse,

And not even the dreary presence of a mouse.

His soul had decayed, as well as the rest of him,

As his skin discolored and pealed from the limb,

Few knew him, but all looked down on Harold,

The mutant whose malnourishment left him slim.

His story would cause your spine to run cold,

It told why his body now sprouted green mold.

Tragedy had been his calling, and he answered,

But inadvertently, at least, he firmly claimed.

It was an accident, incident, and in end tragedy,

One that left his body now and forever maimed.

His allies left or disappeared on that very day,

And he was found in the desert, he would say.

His story, was not in my thoughts at present,

But instead someone else and what he meant,

Resided in my mind. Curiosity rampaged it,

As to the cave the man would have me sent.

From his ramblings about a first-aid kit,

I had the feeling my skin would be slit.

I wandered further, trying to hide all sound,

When I heard a howl, as of a great hound

That had been stricken down and now hurt,

Perhaps because it was receiving a pound.

The sound, so close, put my senses on alert,

Because for death I felt I had no current cert.

In the distance I saw a light shining, emitting,

The source unknown, it was unremitting, unstopping.

Puzzled, I continued onward slowly, cautiously.

I was able to make out a figure laying, resting,

On the ground, as if it received something deadly.

I thought it was dead, until it cried out painfully.

I knew it wasn't human, but something different,

Something monstrous, and doubtlessly indeferent.

I wondered what could have happened to the beast,

How it could have been injured to such a great extent.

It moaned one last time, and then all sound ceased.

I watched the creature, but it did not move in the least.

Suddenly, movement from the side caught my sight,

But it was shielded by darkness, just out of the light.

Stillness then resumed. I waited for more movement,

But silence persisted, causing me to think it might

Have been my imagination; it does not seek development.

Waiting, peering into darkness, I soon grew impatient.

Drawing my weapon, ever so slowly, ever so silently,

As I prepared to advance, hoping it would not be regretfully

To venture onward. Suddenly, something caught my eye,

To my right, the beast rushed on me ever so relentlessly,

The horrid beast had shocked me; it was definitely sly.

Now I turned to fight it, almost certain that I would die.

The beast was tall, fierce, muscular, and also intimidating,

His eyes contained a fire that hid what he was contemplating.

Rows of jagged teeth, blood dripping down from each one,

Probably from his last victim, the thought was nauseating.

Huge claws, pointy and shiny, could be stopped by none.

The beast growled loudly, a growl that would scare anyone.

I knew that this beast was what I had come in search for,

It was a Death Claw; I had imagined less, but it was much more,

Than I had expected, and I now began to greatly worry.

I was not prepared for a beast with strength of such great galore.

My equipment would not hold, and I began to feel sorry

For coming here; I was not ready for a fight this gory.

The Death Claw raised his heavy claw, getting ready to attack.

I raised my gun and fired, but the beast did not draw back.

It did not flinch, did not move, instead it growled with anger.

The bullet penetrated, and the beast bled blood that was black.

My eyes opened wide in terror, and I suddenly was very eager

To leave this place, but knew my chances were too meager.

The Death Claw sliced down with his claw, and instantly I felt pain.

I felt the coldness of each claw penetrate my torso; I knew I was slain.

The claws dug downward, ripping apart my organs and my bones.

The beast then removed his claws; the feeling was driving me insane.

I gasped for breath, but all that escaped my mouth were meager moans.

The claw destroyed my lungs, so all I could utter were suppressed groans.

I moved my hands slowly to my chest, fearing what I would find.

I looked down at my torso, causing more pain to enter my mind

As I saw the horrific site, I was amazed that I was still living.

It amazed me how a human could survive a wound of that kind.

Blood gushed outward, and with it my organs too started falling,

I cringed in pain as my intestines fell to the ground, splashing.

I pulled my eyes shut; the site was too much for me to take.

I wished now never to have come to this cave, for my sake.

I heard the sound of more organs splashing on the ground.

I looked up at the Death Claw, wondering what it would take

To defeat such a being. Whatever it was, it wasn't found

Inside me. I tried to yell, but could not make any sound.

I knew that it was over, and I was going to now perish.

It would be a moment that the Death Claw would cherish.

It had defeated another one who had searched for him,

One who had wanted to slay it, but would not accomplish

Such a task; chances for success were truly very slim.

And now, the results for me were nothing less than grim.

I fell to the ground, and as I did, came to a realization

That distinctly shed new light on this entire situation.

Many had come to this place to conquer the creature,

But in reality were demonstrating human temptation

To be superior by any means. It was the prime feature

Of the way of humans, their present, past, and future.

The only species on the earth that strived for dominance,

Humans drove Death Claws to such massive violence.

Eager to defeat the beast, wanting superiority over it,

The entire race drove the Claws to such vehemence.

It wanted to live, to survive, and was forced to simply hit

Back on us to survive; we drove the beast to this vivacity
