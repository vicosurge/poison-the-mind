Random Rendering #003

Written by:  Scotty the Great

He looked up and set his gaze to the bright sun,

And wondered about what he had done.

To give no regard to his horrid past

Almost made him feel at peace at last.

But one can never fully be free

Of the burden of such treachery.

As the past will always return to haunt,

And those memories will always taunt,

And now he finds himself hopelessly confused,

With the horror of how he had been abused.

Cast out of the home he fought to save,

After such the risk of an early grave;

It seemed unreal, and certainly improbable.

But he should have seen what was so palpable!

The Overseer may have spoken the truth,

And he had robbed the vault of its youth.

They followed him and created a village

In isolation, seemingly safe from any pillage.

Of course that does not forgive what was done.

The overseer sent him away as if he was no one!

And at first his following made him quite overjoyed,

As he knew his old friend must have been annoyed.

But now, he looked around and saw his tribe

And shuddered briefly from this new bad vibe

For his years had quickly passed him by

And this depressing thought made him sigh.

He eagerly wished back his youth when he was stronger,

But that was gone, and he would not live much longer.

What is to become when he dies

Of the village Vault 13 does despise?

He wished he had not been followed,

For this is the sorrow in which he now wallowed.

If he had been alone, there would not be

The worry of the approaching travesty.

He thought without me, their grand hero,

My people are as doomed as those at ground zero.

If I lived my days alone and simply died

There would be no one that wouldve cried.

I do not want to leave them right now.

And then he wiped the sweat from his brow.

He looked back to his village and grinned

And realized, despite how his past was sinned,

That after him there would always be his son

Who would protect the village as the Chosen One.

That thought struck him with intrigue,

And now his eyes blinked from fatigue.

He was old and realized he needed sleep

And now he knew the village would weep.

But regardless of his tortured past

He felt sure the pain would not last.
